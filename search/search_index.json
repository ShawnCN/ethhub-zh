Most applications today fall into the following categories. Decentralized Finance Decentralized finance refers to a number of decentralized protocols building open financial infrastructure. These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. Oracles Oracles refers to a protocols or services to connect Ethereum to offchain information. They can be utilized for querying information from the internet (e.g. API calls), information about other chains (e.g. BTC transactions), or even as dispute resolution mechanisms concerning non-native assets. Decentralized Exchanges Decentralized Exchanges allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences. Gaming Blockchain games are any games that include blockchain technology in its backend or mechanics in general. Collectibles Crypto collectibles are unique items that adhere to the ERC-721 standard. They can be collected and perhaps used across many different games and applications built on Ethereum. Marketplaces Marketplaces built on Ethereum allow for the trading of ERC-721 tokens such as crypto collectibles. Developer Tools A suite of developer tools allow for better standards and easy implementation of these standards across many different applications. Identity Identity is a very important aspect to the future of Ethereum. The Ethereum network hosts many DApps that are building identity systems. These DApps leverage the secure and decentralized nature of the Ethereum network often in collaboration with decentralized storage protocols such as IPFS or SWARM to enable empower and protect consumers' information. Citizens will be able to confidentionally reveal personal information such as Gov. ID, credit score, medical history, banking information, etc. to others in a way that also allows them to revoke future access to such information. Governance Given the decentralized nature of the protocol, it\u2019s important for some applications to have a way to govern their team, project or app. Infrastructure Building out basic infrastructure needs using Ethereum as a base layer. Token Curated Registries Token Curated Registries are registries of listings generated by token holders. Listings can be anything from names to hashes of full-blown records stored in IPFS.

DutchX uses the Dutch auction principle which attempts to fix issues faced by other decentralized exchanges such as front running, low liquidity and third party risk. Since 28.June 2019 dxDAO is owner of the DutchX protocol governed be reputation holders. How an auction works Sellers deposit tokens they want to sell to the exchange and pick what token they want in return. Once a $1,000 threshold in deposits for the pair is reached, the auction starts at 2x the previous closing price. The price of the pair starts falling according to a price decreasing function. Bidders can now begin to place their bids and immediately claim tokens bought even if the auction hasn't cleared yet. Once the entire sell side is accounted for, the auction clears and everyone who bid pays that price for the tokens. This means those who bid higher can come back and claim more tokens.

Only one contract can be deployed for each token address. The price of tokens is based on the amount of liquidity in the contract.

In case a token price significantly shifts from its market price, arbitrage opportunities are created, and the price will eventually be corrected.

However, two-thirds of the population remains unbanked. 70 million Filipinos have severely limited access to both the domestic and global financial ecosystems. This poses a significant problem when up to 10% of the Philippines' GDP is made up of international remittances sent from overseas workers to family members across the country. Solution UnionBank of the Philippines, one of the largest banking institutions in the country, sought to tackle this challenge by partnering with ConsenSys Solutions, Kaleido, Amazon AWS, ConsenSys Diligence, Microsoft Azure, and seven rural Philippine banks to create an inter-rural bank payment platform using Enterprise Ethereum. Project i2i implemented Enterprise Ethereum to create a decentralized, cost-efficient, real-time inter-rural bank payment platform that operates autonomously outside of existing payment infrastructures and intermediaries such as the Philippines' PhilPass and SWIFT. The Project i2i platform works to connect rural banks as well as national commercial banks to the central bank, helping remote banks integrate with the domestic financial system while also improving banking access for local citizens. The commercial launch of the i2i platform is scheduled for 2019, in partnership with 130 rural banks. Project i2i has received clearance and support from the central bank of the Philippines to operate as the country's first Ethereum-based payment network for domestic funds transfers. UnionBank and ConsenSys Solutions are now working toward expanding the platform to include international funds transfer.

SARB created a simulation to assess if the performance, scale, and confidentiality of payments were possible utilizing blockchain technology. Solution In consortium with seven commercial banks, SARB partnered with ConsenSys Solutions and Adhara, to build a proof-of-concept grounded in real-world performance, confidentiality requirements, and diverse bank hardware on the blockchain\u2014without a single point of failure. By harnessing a permissioned blockchain network, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism, Pedersen commitments, and range proofs, Project Khoka was able to replicate interbank clearing and settlements in less than two hours. The project achieved the transaction performance target at 70,000 transactions in less than two hours, privacy while meeting required transaction volumes. Project Khokha was recognized by the Central Bank Publication as the \"Best Distributed Ledger Initiative\" of 2018. Case study can be downloaded from here Project Ubin: Blockchain for Banking in Singapore Problem Statement Singaporean financial institutions are recognized for their efficiency. Their public policy is exported as a blueprint for other central systems around the world. Recently, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) began exploring the potentials of distributed ledger technology in regards to finance and banking applications. Solution MAS launched a three-phase exercise in partnership with a consortium of international banks, distributed ledger technologies, and blockchain providers. Phase 1 consisted of a research and feasibility study around the potential applications of blockchain technology. The study explored: Benefits and pitfalls of tokenizing central bank currency Optimizing payment settlements between participating local banks Steps to enable cross-border transactions Effective methods of digitizing payments Phase 2 focused on how to use blockchain platforms and tokenization in the daily settlement and clearing process to enable RTGS. During this phase, MAS partnered with ConsenSys Solutions and JP Morgan's Quorum enterprise blockchain platform. Together, they successfully demonstrated how a tokenized Singaporean dollar could function as a means of daily inter-bank settlement. Phase 3 explored the potentials of a tokenized national currency and realizing cross-border payments through blockchain technology. Project Ubin's results prove that inter-bank transactions, cross-border remittances, and tokenized securities can be settled with distributed ledger technology with full settlement finality and transaction privacy.

Their public policy is exported as a blueprint for other central systems around the world. Recently, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) began exploring the potentials of distributed ledger technology in regards to finance and banking applications. Solution MAS launched a three-phase exercise in partnership with a consortium of international banks, distributed ledger technologies, and blockchain providers. Phase 1 consisted of a research and feasibility study around the potential applications of blockchain technology. The study explored: Benefits and pitfalls of tokenizing central bank currency Optimizing payment settlements between participating local banks Steps to enable cross-border transactions Effective methods of digitizing payments Phase 2 focused on how to use blockchain platforms and tokenization in the daily settlement and clearing process to enable RTGS. During this phase, MAS partnered with ConsenSys Solutions and JP Morgan's Quorum enterprise blockchain platform. Together, they successfully demonstrated how a tokenized Singaporean dollar could function as a means of daily inter-bank settlement. Phase 3 explored the potentials of a tokenized national currency and realizing cross-border payments through blockchain technology. Project Ubin's results prove that inter-bank transactions, cross-border remittances, and tokenized securities can be settled with distributed ledger technology with full settlement finality and transaction privacy.

A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations (for example, semi-fungible tokens). Motivation Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each fungible or NFT token/collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of crypto games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of tokens, and a new type of token standard is needed to support this. New functionality is possible with this design, such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to \"approve\" individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible tokens in a single contract. Batch Transfers The safeBatchTransferFrom function allows for batch transfers of multiple token ids and values. Gas savings improves with the number of token types in the batch transfer, compared to single transfers with multiple transactions. Approval Single-token based approval of specific token values has been dropped in favor of the function setApprovalForAll which allows an operator to manage one's entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. To scope an approval to a specific set or quantity of tokens, we recommend deploying a contract that contains the desired rules, and directing end-users to approve this contract to manage their set of tokens.

While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Each NFT is identified through an uint256 ID. They may be transferred through two different funcions: A safe transfer function safeTansferFrom() which verifies that the msg.sender ,i.e. the user that triggered the function, is the owner of the token or an authorized user allowed to transfer the token. A non-secure trasfer transferFrom() , where there is no preliminary authorization verification. The token developer is responsible for implementing a piece of code in this function that verifies that the responsible for calling the function is authorized to do so. In this function, the user calling it must also verify that the receiver is entitle for receiving the token. If these verifications are not performed, the tokens could be lost forever. ERC721 tokens must implement the proposed ERC165 interface. This standard allows the detection of the interfaces implemented by a contract. This is really useful, as it allows to detect the interface that a token implements and, consequently, adapt the method/code to interact with it. What does \u201cfungible\u201d mean?! If an item is fungible, then it can be substituted or exchanged for any similar item. Fiat currencies, like the US dollar, contain fungible units. One dollar bill can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MANA are all fungible because one token can be exchanged for any other token. The only thing that changes is a record on the blockchain registering the transaction. It must follow that two non-fungible tokens are not interchangeable. So what is it about non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that gives them this quality? The answer lies in the data or information stored within NFTs. We can compare two real-world examples of fungible and non-fungible items that most people should be familiar with: dollars and movie tickets. Dollars These are obviously fungible, if I have a dollar and you have a dollar, we can trade the two and neither of us will be any richer or poorer than we were before. Movie tickets NFTs are the digital manifestation of items like movie tickets, in that they can contain information in addition to just the owner, lending them all sorts of uses and unforeseen value. Put simply: you could have a movie ticket for Star Wars whereas I could have a movie ticket for Avengers. These tickets are not equal in properties or value which makes them non-fungible. ERC721 ERC721 was written to standardize non-fungible tokens. By standardizing NFTs, the developer community ushered in a new ecosystem of digital content, games, and applications that use NFTs.

Each kitty exists on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC721 non-fungible token. Each ERC721 kitty has a unique ID, genes that defines its appearance and rarity, a generation that affects the kitty's rarity, and a cooldown that determines how long the cat must wait before it can breed again. For a small fee, players can breed two kitties together to create a new ERC721 kitty. The new kitten's traits are randomly determined through the combination of the traits of its parents and an on-chain random number oracle, although its generation will always be greater than that of its parents. Generation The game began with the creation of 50,000 Generation 0 kitties. The smart contract does not allow any more Generation 0 kitties to be created beyond 50,000. Whenever two kitties breed, the generation of their offspring is equal to the highest generation of either parent plus one. For example, if two Generation 0 kitties breed, they create a Generation 1 kitty. If a Generation 0 and a Generation 8 kitty breed, they create a Generation 9 kitty. This mechanic of increasing a kitty's generation with each breed preserves the rarity of lower gneeration Cryptokitties, preventing users from flooding the marketplace and destroying the value of all kitties. Genes Each kitty has 48 genes, spanning twelve different gene categories. Within each category, each kitty has a dominant gene, a hidden-1 gene, a hidden-2 gene, and a hidden-3 gene. The dominant genes are the genes that determine a kitty's appearance. When breeding two kitty's together, the offspring is likely to get the dominant gene of either parent for each category, but has a small chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-1 genes, an even smaller chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-2 genes, and a very small chance of getting one of the parent's hidden-3 genes. When two parent's have genes that match up in a certain way, then there is a small chance of that gene \"mewtating\" into a higher-tier gene that neither parent had originally had. The community has created calculators for determining the probabilities of the genes of a given offspring, such as KittyCalc , and the community has created trait charts that demonstrate the mewtation process, which can be found at KittyHelper and at KittyFyi . For a more detailed explanation, see the section labeled Genes under the CryptoKitties Guide below. Cooldown Each cat has a cooldown that determines how long a user must wait before they can breed the cat again. A kitty's initial cooldown is determined by its generation. The higher the generation, the worse the cooldown the kitty is born with. Cooldowns range from 1 minute to 1 week. Each time that a kitty breeds, its cooldown increases, to a maximum of one week. The kitty's offspring will not be born until the cooldown has completed. History Gods Unchained crossover On January 10th, 2019, a partnership between CryptoKitties and the trading card game Gods Unchained was announced . The partnership was significant because it featured extensibility for the first time between two blockchain games. Extensibility is the ability to use an NFT from one game in another game. Between Jan. 10th to Jan. 28th, 2019, Cryptokitties users were able to convert any Cryptokitty into a Gods Unchained statue for a small fee. The Cryptokitty statue is purely used for aesthetic purposes in the Gods Unchained game, allowing a Gods Unchained user to decorate their board while playing a match but having no in-game effect on the game's mechanics. However, each statue's appearance differed depending on the on-chain genes that the Cryptokitty had, meaning that certain kitty's with rarer genes could create rarer statues. This demonstrates how one blockchain game can make use of the information contained within the ERC-721 tokens of another blockchain game, opening up an entire universe of possibilities for interoperability and cross-game collaboration. Noteably, the statue-creation process did not destroy the Cryptokitty that was used, meaning that a user could take a single NFT token and use its unique information in a variety of different games and different contexts, while still retaining its value in the original blockchain game. The event also provided the ability for Crypokitty's users to create, buy, or win Gods Unchained-themed Cryptokitties, including creating one of 3,992 TallyThePurrocious fancy cats, buying one of 380 Aeoncat special edition cats, or winning the one and only Hyppurrion exclusive cat.

This includes up to three additional monsters that you'll need to catch and hang on to to trigger the transforming proress. Having ancestors present in the battle party increases the descendant's attack stats in battle. Monsters can have up to 3 forms and require a level minimum and ancestors present to transform. Some monsters can lay an egg create another monster, generally at a mid-30s level. Also some monsters lose the ability to lay an egg after transforming. Adventure Sites Part of the Etheremon adventure play is sending your monsters to Adventure Sites. These adventures cost a small entry fee, but a monster can find battle shards, level stones or even other monsters. The fee from the adventure cost is split among the 10 site owners. Currently the cost is 0.1 Ether or 15 EMONT. Battle Modes There are 2 types of battling: Ranked and Practice. Ranked mode battles include 3 one-on-one battles of attacking mosters, best 2 out of 3 wins. The 3 attacking monsters can be supported by 3 defending monsters. The supporting lineup is crucial to build strong teams. With wins trainers can increase their rank, while loses will decrease their rank.

The game is free to download and you're immediately able to play with several pre-built decks. The more you play, the more cards you earn. Gods Unchained has many different sets of cards. Core: these are the cards you earn when you play through the game. Genesis: this was the first set of cards that were sold before the game launched. Genesis cards are no longer in production and Immutable have vowed never to make any more and never to change their abilities going into the future. If you want one for your deck there are several online marketplaces where you can purchase cards from other players. Season 1: these cards have yet to be released but are known and several beta testers have gotten the opportunity to try them out. Paid cards are verifiably scarce and have their stats and ownership history recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Gods Unchained also features other collectibles that grant special cosmetic benefits and can be displayed in matches against other players. All Gods Unchained gameplay occurs off-chain and incurs no transaction fees. Activating and Trading Cards Play-to-Earn A big ethos supported by the game developers and the players is the idea that playing the game should earn you a sellable asset \u2013 allowing you to play and make money. This ethos can be seen in developers\u2019 thoughts around making genesis cards scarce and their novel attempts at limiting supply of the Core cards. While it remains to be seen whether or not an active \u201cprofessional\u201d scene will be possible, the developers have put a lot of time and thought in attempting to bring it to life. Marketplaces Since cards are actual tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, they can be traded in any format a token can be traded. Though, there are 3 active specialized marketplaces. The largest and most liquid is https://tokentrove.com/ . This is third-party owned and does some aggregating from other sources. While the prices are generally a bit worse, it is by far the most convenient place to trade. Lastly, a lot of bundles are sold directly on the OpenSea marketplace. FLUX - Activating cards on the blockchain Recently, Immutable has introduced the FLUX system. This is a system (all in-game) for turning an in-game asset into an actual token on Ethereum as not all in-game assets are automatically tokens. This is to prevent bots from earning a ridiculous number of tokens and ruining the market for everyone. FLUX is earned through normal play and the in-game 'forge' is used to send your tokens to your Ethereum-based wallet Game Mechanics Gods Unchained builds on the classic gameplay mechanics made famous by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. New to Gods Unchained is an innovate new mana system that forces players to begin engaging on turn 1. The game also supports a massive variety of possible matches by giving each player the choice of up to four special god powers at the start of each match. Since the game has six gods to play with and each god can use one of four powers . Additionally, Immutable has long been making additional warriors for each God. These warriors will be playable as well adding 5 additional personas to play each with their own powers. A recently added feature called Sanctum adds a new distinct element to the game which allows players to pull in a card not previously included in their deck directly into play. This is one of the most recent endeavors to increase the complexity and possible add a little more originality Comparison to MTG Overall, the game runs close enough to MTG. There are 2 big differences: 1 - Mana is standardized and increasing each turn. So you don\u2019t have to think about contrasting a deck with mana. This prevents frustration often felt in MTG with either mana flooding or getting mana screwed. But it also removes a large element of complexity associated with deck generation and means that large casting creatures/spells are relatively easy to play 2 - Players can only make plays (decisions) during their own turn. So, things alternate more cleanly. There are mostly the same types of decks to be created (aggro/control/combo). And while the game is still increasing in complexity, overall, it includes the same types of strategic fun. History Open Beta Gods Unchained is currently in open beta. Downloading the Apollo client and creating an account will get new players signed up and new beta players are being added daily. Etherbots crossover Etherbots , by the same studio Immutable, was originally launched in March 2018 and included battling completely on-chain. To promote interoperability Etherbots holders were rewarded with exclusive Gods Unchained cards for their early contributions. Etherbots 2 is expected after Gods Unchained is fully launched. CryptoKitties crossover On January 10th, 2019, a partnership between Gods Unchained and the kitty-breeding collectible game CryptoKitties was announced . Between Jan. 10th to Jan. 21st, 2019, CryptoKitty owners were able to forge statues in Gods Unchained, including a special Talisman based on a new fancy cat called Tally the Furrocious. 380 Special-Edition Gods Unchained Aeoncat Kitties were made available for purchase. Each Aeoncat granted its owner a chance to win the exclusive Hypurrion kitty, modelled after GU's Hyperion.

If you want one for your deck there are several online marketplaces where you can purchase cards from other players. Season 1: these cards have yet to be released but are known and several beta testers have gotten the opportunity to try them out. Paid cards are verifiably scarce and have their stats and ownership history recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

New to Gods Unchained is an innovate new mana system that forces players to begin engaging on turn 1. The game also supports a massive variety of possible matches by giving each player the choice of up to four special god powers at the start of each match. Since the game has six gods to play with and each god can use one of four powers . Additionally, Immutable has long been making additional warriors for each God. These warriors will be playable as well adding 5 additional personas to play each with their own powers. A recently added feature called Sanctum adds a new distinct element to the game which allows players to pull in a card not previously included in their deck directly into play.

There are 2 big differences: 1 - Mana is standardized and increasing each turn. So you don\u2019t have to think about contrasting a deck with mana. This prevents frustration often felt in MTG with either mana flooding or getting mana screwed. But it also removes a large element of complexity associated with deck generation and means that large casting creatures/spells are relatively easy to play 2 - Players can only make plays (decisions) during their own turn. So, things alternate more cleanly. There are mostly the same types of decks to be created (aggro/control/combo). And while the game is still increasing in complexity, overall, it includes the same types of strategic fun.","title":"Comparison to MTG"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/games/gods-unchained/#history","text":"","title":"History"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/games/gods-unchained/#open-beta","text":"Gods Unchained is currently in open beta.

ERC 725 is a proposed standard for blockchain-based identity authored by Fabian Vogelsteller, creator of ERC 20 and Web3.js. ERC 725 describes proxy smart contracts that can be controlled by multiple keys and other smart contracts. ERC 735 is an associated standard to add and remove claims to an ERC 725 identity smart contract. These identity smart contracts can describe humans, groups, objects, and machines. ERC 725 lives on the Ethereum blockchain. Why ERC 725? ERC 725 allows for self-sovereign identity. Users should be able to own and manage their identity instead of ceding ownership of identity to centralized organizations. We have seen the negative effects of having centralized identity with damaging leaks and unfair selling of user data and identity. An open, portable standard for identities will enable decentralized reputation, governance, and more. Users will be able to take their identity across different Dapps and platforms that support this standard.

It allows anyone to buy and manage .eth domains without relying on a centralized domain registrar. The owner of a domain can map it to any string value. One example is creating a human-readable name for his Ethereum wallet by resolving a personal domain to it. The owner can also create and manage subdomains. Each domain has an owner, resolver, and time-to-live record and is stored in the ENS registry. Resolvers are smart contracts that can provide any information about given domain. Owner of the domain can choose a resolver and transfer the ownership of the domain as well as its subdomains. History Launch The ENS launched on May 4th, 2017 with a temporary registrar contract featuring a Vickrey auction design for registering domains. Vickrey Auction Process Explained First, someone looking to register an ENS domain was required to make a minimum bid of at least 0.01 ETH which opened an auction for the desired name. This started a 3-day timer for other people to place bids on the name. During this period, the details of bids were obscured: nobody could tell how much you bid, or even what name you were bidding on. After the three day auction finished, a two day \u201creveal\u201d period would begin. During this period, everyone who made a bid must have revealed the details of their bid\u200a\u2014\u200aif they didn\u2019t, they lost their entire bid. If your bid was not the highest, you were refunded your bid, minus a 0.5% fee which was burned. At the end of the two day reveal period, the winner was the person who revealed the highest bid, but they only had to pay the amount of the second-highest bidder. This amount was locked up in the contract as a deposit until the permanent registrar came. The winner was required to send a \u201cfinalise\u201d transaction to receive a refund of any extra funds, and to be assigned control of the name in ENS. Upgrade to Permenant Registrar At 00:00 UTC May 4th, 2019, the ENS was upgraded to a permanent registrar contract which did away with the Vickrey auction system in lieu of instant registration for ENS domains seven characters or longer. The new registrar requires domain holders to pay $5/year paid in Ether to main. Domains registered before this update are required to migrate to the new registrar but are not required to pay this yearly fee until after May 4, 2020. Registering an ENS domain Registering a domain on the ENS will cost you $5/year paid in Ether. See here for a step-by-step guide to registering an ENS domain. Registering ENS domain names shorter than 7 characters With the May 4th, 2019 update to the permenant registrar, ENS intends to start opening up registrations of names shorter than 7 characters. This will start with a preregistration process, during which owners of existing DNS domains can claim the corresponding ENS name for their project. After that, an auction process will start in which anyone can bid on the newly available names, and then finally open the rest up for instant registration. See here for more information.

These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. In the existing system, all financial services are controlled by a central party. Whether it's basic money transfers, asset purchases, or lending, you must go through an intermediary who charges rent for mediating financial transactions. Ethereum-based financial services, on the other hand, connect individuals peer-to-peer and allow them to access basic financing more easily and affordably. How is all this possible? A big reason the financial services industry is as bloated as it is today is because financial transactions in the digital realm are not secure. We have no method of trusting our online counterparties so we pay fees to financial institutions who enforce that trust. Ethereum leverages the same principles that create 'digital trust' within Bitcoin, and applies to them to smart contracts, self-executing pieces of code that execute business logic after some predefined conditions are met.

These protocols are valuable because they're creating the necessary plumbing to enable anyone in the world with an internet connection to access self-sovereign, censorship resistant financial services. In the existing system, all financial services are controlled by a central party. Whether it's basic money transfers, asset purchases, or lending, you must go through an intermediary who charges rent for mediating financial transactions. Ethereum-based financial services, on the other hand, connect individuals peer-to-peer and allow them to access basic financing more easily and affordably.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/what-is-open-finance/#how-is-all-this-possible","text":"A big reason the financial services industry is as bloated as it is today is because financial transactions in the digital realm are not secure.

The Dai Card uses payment channel hubs - a L2 solution built on top of Ethereum - to allow for instant and micro-fee transactions for users and developers. How to Use the Dai Card Getting Funds There are multiple ways to get funds onto your Dai Card. The first is to directly send funds (i.e. \"deposit\") to the Dai Card's address. You can deposit either ETH or Dai. If you deposit ETH, it will be instantly and automatically swapped into Dai at the current Eth-Dai price. Note: the beta version of the Dai Card imposes a $30 limit and will refund any deposits above this amount. You can also request funds from someone else who is already using a Dai Card. This can be done by clicking the request button and entering in how much you\u2019d like to request. A link will be generated and can be sent to the person you want to request from. The first transaction that is sent to your Card will take some extra time to execute. This is because, in the background, an onchain transaction is being done to set up your Card. Sending Funds There are two different ways to send funds. If the receiver already has a Dai Card and you know their address, then it\u2019s best to just use the simple send functionality. If the receiver has never used a Dai Card before, you can use a Link payment instead. Link payments generate an unspent payment object which can be \"claimed\" by the recipient that produces the correct secret. Note that the link generated here contains the secret to redeem funds in plaintext, so you should be careful with it. Settings It\u2019s possible to backup your Card's seed and restore it in any browser, at any time. You can also restore this seed in other wallets such as Metamask, MyCrypto or TrustWallet. However, this will not give you access to the channel funds themselves, only the signing key used to control those funds. FAQ When I deposit ETH into a Card and I receive Dai, is the ETH being automatically sold to Connext? A: Yes. Connext's payment channel hub automatically swaps any ETH for Dai that you deposit at market price. The swapped ETH then goes into the hub's collateral reserves, which is used either when users \"cash out\" in Eth or when more Dai needs to be bought by the Connext team. Since it's much easier for most users to get access to Eth than Dai (and to off-ramp to fiat from Eth), Connext expects that this will make it simpler to use Dai for everyday payments. If I deposit 1 ETH into a channel can I later withdraw 1 ETH from that channel? For example, if the price of ETH goes up while my ETH is in a channel and I then withdraw it, do I get the value of the ETH at the time of withdraw or at the time of deposit? A: No. You are swapping into Dai when you use the Card. Users have the benefit of being protected from volatility but, obviously, this means that you wouldn\u2019t see the upside of an Eth bull run. Since you're not meant to hold large amounts of value in your Card anyway (only daily spending cash), the upside that you would miss out on should be minimal. Is the Dai Card noncustodial? A: The concept of custodial is more nuanced for channels: In Connext's payment channel hub system, your funds are always your own since you can exit the system at any time by sending your latest channel state to the payment channel contract. This can be done regardless of the status of the hub - i.e. it is completely uncensorable. Note, this assumes that you have access to your channel state - the Connext team is still working on making sure that this will always be the case. A payment itself can be custodial. This means that for the brief moment that a payment is \"in-flight\", it can be intercepted and/or censored by the hub. Obviously, if this happened and you knew about it, you would exit the system so your financial risk is constrained by the size of the payment itself. Payments can also be noncustodial using more complex mechanisms (such as lightning-style HTLCs or, in Connext's case, a dispute-based system called \"threads). Connext's system is live with custodial payments for now. The noncustodial payment code is in the hub and client codebase as part of the launch, but the team is still working on making sure that the user experience of noncustodial payments is seamless, and so they have kept it deactivated for the initial launch. They plan to reactivate it within the first couple of weeks of going live. For a more in-depth breakdown of the current trust assumptions in the system and how the team plans to address them, please see Connext's Dai Card launch post here . What is the difference between this approach and Sidechain/Plasma approaches like xDai? A: The primary difference between channels and sidechains are that channels are a solution that scale up the existing blockchain whereas sidechains shift load out onto other chains. Because channelized systems can be built on top of any underlying chain, they are theoretically better for widespread horizontal infrastructure that aims to serve ALL users whereas sidechain/plasma based solutions are better for application-specific use cases. Think of the difference between the Visa network and Uber. At scale, sidechains and plasma suffer from the same scalability problems as the base chain, which would require creating further sub-chains or using channels to solve. Moving into and out of sidechains/plasma systems can be more difficult since it involves moving value across different chains, rather than within the base chain. In the event of a mass exit from the system (because the chain went down), it is also sometimes unclear how all users could move their value back onto the base chain. However, sidechains/plasma are much more flexible once within the system, do not require significant collateral lockuup to run, and do not require counterparties to be online/available. Channels, on the other hand, are easier to get into and out of. They are also much cheaper to run/scale and funds can always be exited onto the base chain no matter the circumstances. The downsides of channel networks are that they require intermediaries to hold collateral in order to ensure that a transaction will be completed and that they require that those intermediaries (and counterparties) to be available when a transaction occurs. Note that the availability requirements can be improved with better conditional payment functionality. Does Connext have to put reserves in the channel itself? Can this run or cap out? A: Yes. The ChannelManager contract (0xdfa6edae2ec0cf1d4a60542422724a48195a5071) has Eth and Dai reserves in it. All channels are automatically collateralized based on the reserves in this contract. If it runs out, channels would stop being collateralized and this would interrupt payments. If a channel stops being collateralized, how will users be alerted that payments are currently interrupted (e.g. does the UI show an alert and grey\u2019s out the SEND button)? How long might outages last, on average? A: The most noticeable instance of this occurring will be when a Card receives its first payment. For a standard payment, the sender's UI will state that the receiver's Card is still being set up and whill show a progress indicator. For a link payment, the redeem payment screen will state that the Card is being set up and will show a similar progress indicator. In both of these cases, collateralization of the channel occurs in the background and takes ~30-40s (block time + 2 block confirmations) to complete. Aside from these instances, most payments should be instant. Connext is still working on better ways to optmistically allocate collateral to channels so users can expect the user experience around this to improve with time.

The swapped ETH then goes into the hub's collateral reserves, which is used either when users \"cash out\" in Eth or when more Dai needs to be bought by the Connext team. Since it's much easier for most users to get access to Eth than Dai (and to off-ramp to fiat from Eth), Connext expects that this will make it simpler to use Dai for everyday payments. If I deposit 1 ETH into a channel can I later withdraw 1 ETH from that channel? For example, if the price of ETH goes up while my ETH is in a channel and I then withdraw it, do I get the value of the ETH at the time of withdraw or at the time of deposit? A: No. You are swapping into Dai when you use the Card. Users have the benefit of being protected from volatility but, obviously, this means that you wouldn\u2019t see the upside of an Eth bull run. Since you're not meant to hold large amounts of value in your Card anyway (only daily spending cash), the upside that you would miss out on should be minimal. Is the Dai Card noncustodial? A: The concept of custodial is more nuanced for channels: In Connext's payment channel hub system, your funds are always your own since you can exit the system at any time by sending your latest channel state to the payment channel contract. This can be done regardless of the status of the hub - i.e. it is completely uncensorable. Note, this assumes that you have access to your channel state - the Connext team is still working on making sure that this will always be the case. A payment itself can be custodial. This means that for the brief moment that a payment is \"in-flight\", it can be intercepted and/or censored by the hub. Obviously, if this happened and you knew about it, you would exit the system so your financial risk is constrained by the size of the payment itself. Payments can also be noncustodial using more complex mechanisms (such as lightning-style HTLCs or, in Connext's case, a dispute-based system called \"threads). Connext's system is live with custodial payments for now. The noncustodial payment code is in the hub and client codebase as part of the launch, but the team is still working on making sure that the user experience of noncustodial payments is seamless, and so they have kept it deactivated for the initial launch. They plan to reactivate it within the first couple of weeks of going live. For a more in-depth breakdown of the current trust assumptions in the system and how the team plans to address them, please see Connext's Dai Card launch post here . What is the difference between this approach and Sidechain/Plasma approaches like xDai? A: The primary difference between channels and sidechains are that channels are a solution that scale up the existing blockchain whereas sidechains shift load out onto other chains. Because channelized systems can be built on top of any underlying chain, they are theoretically better for widespread horizontal infrastructure that aims to serve ALL users whereas sidechain/plasma based solutions are better for application-specific use cases. Think of the difference between the Visa network and Uber. At scale, sidechains and plasma suffer from the same scalability problems as the base chain, which would require creating further sub-chains or using channels to solve. Moving into and out of sidechains/plasma systems can be more difficult since it involves moving value across different chains, rather than within the base chain. In the event of a mass exit from the system (because the chain went down), it is also sometimes unclear how all users could move their value back onto the base chain. However, sidechains/plasma are much more flexible once within the system, do not require significant collateral lockuup to run, and do not require counterparties to be online/available. Channels, on the other hand, are easier to get into and out of. They are also much cheaper to run/scale and funds can always be exited onto the base chain no matter the circumstances. The downsides of channel networks are that they require intermediaries to hold collateral in order to ensure that a transaction will be completed and that they require that those intermediaries (and counterparties) to be available when a transaction occurs. Note that the availability requirements can be improved with better conditional payment functionality. Does Connext have to put reserves in the channel itself? Can this run or cap out? A: Yes. The ChannelManager contract (0xdfa6edae2ec0cf1d4a60542422724a48195a5071) has Eth and Dai reserves in it. All channels are automatically collateralized based on the reserves in this contract. If it runs out, channels would stop being collateralized and this would interrupt payments. If a channel stops being collateralized, how will users be alerted that payments are currently interrupted (e.g. does the UI show an alert and grey\u2019s out the SEND button)? How long might outages last, on average? A: The most noticeable instance of this occurring will be when a Card receives its first payment. For a standard payment, the sender's UI will state that the receiver's Card is still being set up and whill show a progress indicator. For a link payment, the redeem payment screen will state that the Card is being set up and will show a similar progress indicator. In both of these cases, collateralization of the channel occurs in the background and takes ~30-40s (block time + 2 block confirmations) to complete. Aside from these instances, most payments should be instant. Connext is still working on better ways to optmistically allocate collateral to channels so users can expect the user experience around this to improve with time.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/payments/daicard/#resources","text":"DeFi Pulse Website","title":"Resources"},{"location":"built-on-ethereum/open-finance/payments/stablepay/","text":"StablePay Summary StablePay is a decentralized payment platform that enables users to make payments or donations with Ethereum or other ERC20 tokens, that get instantly converted to DAI token.

A useful currency should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Cryptocurrencies excel at the first, but as a store of value or unit of account, they\u2019re pretty bad. You cannot be an effective store of value if your price fluctuates by 20% on a normal day. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the effects of price volatility, thus they seek to function as a store of value and a unit of account. To minimize volatility the value of a stablecoin can be pegged to a currency, or to exchange traded commodities (such as precious metals or industrial metals). Stablecoins backed by currencies or commodities directly are said to be centralized, whereas those leveraging other cryptocurrencies are referred to as decentralized. Types of Stablecoins Currency-backed Cryptocurrencies backed by currency (fiat) are the most common and were the first type of stablecoins on the market. Their characteristics are: Their value is pegged to one or more currencies (most commonly the US dollar, also the Euro and the Swiss franc). The peg is realized off-chain, through banks or other types of regulated financial institutions which serve as depositaries of the currency used to back the stablecoin. The amount of the currency used for backing of the stablecoin has to reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin. Notable currency-backed stablecoins: Gemini Dollar USD Coin Tether TrueUSD Paxos Standard Collateralized (crypto-backed) Cryptocurrency backed stablecoins are issued with cryptocurrencies as collateral, which is conceptually similar to fiat-backed stablecoins. However, the significant difference between the two designs is that while fiat collateralization typically happens off the blockchain, the cryptocurrency or crypto asset used to back this type of stablecoins is done on the blockchain, using smart contracts in a more decentralized fashion. For example, MakerDAO's DAI stablecoin is generated when someone opens a collateralized debt position (CDP), deposits some ETH as collateral, and then withdraws DAI from their CDP. The ETH acts as collateral. Notable collateral-backed stablecoins: MakerDAO - DAI Bitshares - BitUSD Synthetix - SUSD Seigniorage (algorithmic) Seigniorage (or algorithmic) stablecoins can be linked to a decentralized autonomous organization which controls issuance and pricing. The supply of algorithmic stablecoins is typically controlled by issuing and destroying coins depending on the market demand, until the target price is reached. In the general case, market participants are incentivized to act in a way that the price is kept at target level by issuing either bonds, in times of decreasing price or seigniorage shares when the price is above target. Notable algorithmic stablecoins: Basis (project was cancelled) Ampleforth Tethered (sub-type of algorithmic) Tethered cryptocurrency assets have certain features of algorithmic stablecoins \u2013 and can be considered their sub-type, except they don\u2019t offer incentives in form of separate instruments (bonds or shares) to holders of the \u201cunderlying\u201d cryptocurrency and there is no governing algorithm that forces the price towards the target, except at the moment of creation of the asset. Tethered cryptocurrency assets are issued on-chain, by holders of the native cryptocurrency, with different pegs chosen by the issuer.

Born as stablecoin project Havven, launched first USD pegged stablecoin in June 2018 . Havven rebranded as Synthetix and expanded its scope to a synthetic asset platform launching on mainnet December 2018 . As of June 2019, the Synthetix platform supports over 20 Synths representing fiat currencies, commodities (e.g., gold), and cryptoassets. Stocks, indices, and other derivatives are expected to be added soon. It is one of the only platforms that supports shorting some tokens via the Synthetic inverse tokens such as iMKR, iXTZ, iBNB, iETH, iBTC. Synthetix has explored novel incentive mechanisms in token economics, including an inflationary monetary policy, establishing a liquidity ramp on Uniswap for traders to enter and exit the Synthetix exchange, and creating a pool of SNX to reward arbitraguers who buy sETH when it is more than 1 basis point off its peg to ETH. Synthetix also created a first-of-its-kind Exchange Index Synth. How Synthetix Works Synthetix has a native token called SNX. Holders lock SNX as collateral to mint Synths, which are freely tradeable ERC20 tokens. Trading fees from Synths exchanged on Synthetix\u2019s non-custodial DEX, Synthetix.Exchange, go to SNX holders/Synth minters, incentivizing Synth creation and giving value to the underlying collateral (i.e., the SNX token). There are two types of staking rewards , SNX inflationary rewards and Synth exchange rewards, which are paid in SNX and sUSD respectively. Exchange rewards are generated by trades on Synthetix.Exchange. The exchange fee (either 0.30% or 0.50%) from each trade is sent to the fee pool where it is available to be claimed by staked SNX holders. To earn rewards from staking SNX , you need to mint sUSD using Mintr. Rewards can be claimed on a weekly basis for up to two weeks. If your Collateralisation Ration is below 675%, you cannot claim rewards until updating your Collateralisation Ration to be at least 675%. As of October 2019, SNX's 78.59% Staking Yield ranks in the top three of all digital assets , according to StakingRewards.com. The average staking yield is 12.66%. The SNX staking community is very active relative to its peers. The Average Stake Ratio among assets reviewed by StakingRewards.com is 37%, while 82% of SNX tokens are staked. Monetary Policy Synthetix initially started with supply of 100 million SNX ECR-20 tokens. In February 2019, shortly after the pivot from Havven to Synthetix, a new monetary policy was instituted to encourage staking on the platform while bootstrapping network effects. Recognizing the SNX token is fundamentally a work token, and not a currency whose primary purpose is purchasing power, the inflation schedule provides for a sequence of decreasing inflationary rewards to SNX stakers. Under the schedule, SNX increases in supply by 75 million from 100 million to 175 million from March 2019 to March 2020 (75% increase). Running up to March 2021, the SNX supply will increase from 175 million to 212.5 million (21% increase). In March 2022, the SNX supply will reach 231.25 million (9% increase. By March 2023, supply will grow to 240.625 million (4% increase). In March 2024, total supply will hit 245,312,500 SNX (2% increase). To mitigate instant dumping of SNX rewards by SNX stakers, which puts downward pressure on SNX price and therefore weakens the value of staked SNX collateral, SNX rewards distributed from March 2019 to March 2020 are locked and cannot be sold on the open market during this period. SNX earned from staking can be collateralized to mint new Synths, however. Uniswap sETH Pool Liquidity Incentive Mechanism In July 2019, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick announced \"an experiment we will be running for the next four weeks to test whether protocol level incentives lead to a deep liquidity pool for the sETH/ETH pair on Uniswap.\" Explaining the motivation for the experiment, Warwick said, \"Think of Uniswap as a gateway into the Synthetix ecosystem, in order to trade on sX you need to have Synths, which right now typically means converting ETH into sUSD. Once you have Synths you can trade on sX and take advantage of the infinite liquidity mechanism allowing you to convert between Synths. What happens though, when you are done trading and want to exit the system back into ETH? Unfortunately there is a significant cost to exit the system as slippage on Uniswap is high and the exchange rate between sUSD/ETH typically trades at a discount of 5-10%.\" The experiment tested how well an incentive of 72,000 SNX per week, 5% of inflation, could attract ETH holders to provide liquidity on Uniswap. \"This experiment will hopefully demonstrate a new kind of composability within the DeFi ecosystem, where protocols can combine incentives across protocols to align incentives in a symbiotic and self reinforcing fashion,\" Warwick said in a blog post at the time. In fewer than three months, the Synthetic Eth:ETH liquidity pool became the largest pool on Uniswap with more than 12,000 ETH and 12,000 sETH. The four-week experiment evolved into Synthetix Improvement Proposal (SIP) 8 . SIP 8 states \"The distribution will be managed by an m/n multisig contract with signers selected from LP providers...By implementing this distribution mechanism using a multisig, we prepare for the next phase of the project where the foundation can no longer modify distribution and other aspects of the system and begin to test aspects of decentralised goveranance.\" sETH:ETH Arbitrage Incentives To strengthen the soft peg between sETH and ETH, Synthetix introduced an arb contract to create an incentive for maintaining sETH:ETH parity. Following a successful experimentation of the arb contract over several weeks in August 2019, 2% of inflation was dedicated toward supporting the arb contract. According to a Synthetix blog post , \"If the sETH/ETH rate on Uniswap falls below 99/100, people can send ETH to the arb contract, which is then converted to SNX at par value. Essentially this means if the sETH ratio falls too low you can use this to exchange ETH to SNX at a discounted rate.\" Index Synths: sCEX and iCEX In August 2019, the first exchange index synths went live on Synthetix.exchange. Dubbed sCEX, the sCEX token represents a basket of tokens issued by the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) in the industry: Binance Coin (BNB), Bitfinex's LEO, Huobi's HT, Okex's OKB, and Kucoin's KuCoin Shares (KCS). This basket provides unique exposure to a new strain of synthetic assets that enables traders and investors to gain exposure to the price of several exchanges' tokens without having to own the underlying tokens or maintain an account with one of the represented exchanges. When sCEX was introduced, so too was iCEX born, which effectively enables beneficial exposure to downward price movement in the aforementioned tokens. Like iXTZ, iMKR, or iBNB, iCEX appreciates in price when its underlying components depreciate. This is akin to taking a short position, though the parameters of Inverse Synths makes the term inverse more appropriate. The inaugural sCEX and iCEX tokens are weighted as follows: BNB (50%), LEO (20%), HT (10%), OKB (10%) and KCS (10%.)

Tellor formed in March 2019, was part of the Binance Labs incubator and launched to mainnet in August 2019. How Tellor Works The Tellor network mints a token, Tributes (TRB). Tellor utilizes a network of miners, required to stake 1000 TRB, competing to solve PoW challenges for the right to submit data to Tellor\u2019s on-chain price feed database. A user submits a query to the Oracle using TRB to incentivize miners to choose this query over other submissions. Other users who want the same data \u2018tip\u2019 this data series to further incentivize selection by miners. Every 10 minutes, the Oracle selects the best funded query and provides a new challenge for miners to solve. Miners submit their PoW solution and off-chain data point to the Oracle contract. The Oracle contract sorts the values as they come in and as soon as five values are received, the official value (median of the five) is selected and saved on-chain. The miners are then allocated their payout (base reward + tips). Anyone holding TRB can dispute the validity of a mined value within one day of it being mined by paying a dispute fee. Over the next week, Tellor token holders will vote on the validity of the data point; if the data point is deemed to be false, the miner will lose their stake.

This is required for security reasons as execution in blockchains must be deterministic and the response to subsequent calls to outside API's could change in unknown ways. Nevertheless, certain desirable types of smart contracts are only possible with additional outside data. An Oracle is a conceptual solution which takes real-world off-chain data and submits an immutable copy of this information into blocks \u2013 thereby making it available for future smart contract use. The Oracle Problem The (\u2018Oracle\u2019) problem is that there are no currently successful decentralized designs. Therefore, all currently functioning oracles are centralized and introduce a series of attack vectors & issues including: Accuracy \u2013 even without malice, a centralized entity is often mistaken about the status or value of something. This prevents an oracle from providing the \u201creal\u201d answer to be memorialized on the blockchain. Gaming \u2013 many oracles are critical for the functioning of smart contracts holding significant amounts of assets. If an attacker can trick the oracle into changing its value then it becomes quite simple to steal assets. Consistency \u2013 the most desired oracles are information streams, where the values change constantly. This means users expect oracles to accurately and consistently provide information on a certain schedule (often every block). However, there is no guarantee that a transaction (to post the information) will be certain to enter a block, no matter the fee that is paid. This is both a usability issue and an attack vector. Solutions Solutions to the oracle problem center around ways to both validate the data being queried and also place this data on chain in both an available and non-centralized manner. The solutions come in two forms. One is to make your centralized oracles better and the second is to make your oracles decentralized. In certain cases, a centralized oracle may be the best solution. For example, for a proprietary dataset which is posted directly by the owner with a widely accepted signature. An example might be a centralized exchange\u2019s daily settlement value posted to the exchange\u2019s website and certified by the exchange\u2019s private key. In such a case, no new risks are incurred by using this oracle above what was already incurred by using the centralized price feed in general. In other cases, a decentralized solution is desirable. This is an active area of research but attempted solutions include consensus-based truth, schelling point oracles (e.g. prediction markets), staked reporters (skin-in-the-game), trusted execution environments (TEEs), and many combinations of the various game theoretic crypto-economic security measures. The main drawback with most of these methods is the same main drawback of blockchains in general. Data points (from the oracle) like blocks (on a blockchain), can only be trusted up to a certain threshold (\u201cthis number/block is correct or $50k will be slashed\u201d). But again, like a blockchain, in certain circumstances by gaming the oracle, an attacker can make more than $50k. So designing systems where assets at stake actually guarantee the validity of the number/content/block is hard and continues to be researched.

They are essentially consensus protocols, which means that different nodes in the network (e.g. computers on the internet) have to be running compatible software. \u201cNode operators\u201d are the owners and managers of nodes that run the protocol. Most node operators don\u2019t want to write much software, and it\u2019s a technical challenge for anyone to independently write compatible implementations of any consensus protocol even if they have a specification. As a result, node operators rely on software repositories (usually hosted on Microsoft/Github servers) to provide them with the software they choose to run. \u201cCore developers\u201d of a blockchain are software developers who work on the software that implement that protocol. Developers have processes that are supposed to assure the quality of the software they release, and are generally very interested in maintaining the legitimacy of their software repositories because they want to see people using their software (as opposed to someone else\u2019s). Critical Components of Governance 1. Incentives Each group in the system has their own incentives. Those incentives are not always 100% aligned with all other groups in the system. Groups will propose changes over time which are advantageous for them. Organisms are biased towards their own survival. This commonly manifests in changes to the reward structure, monetary policy, or balances of power. 2. Mechanisms for Coordination Since it\u2019s unlikely all groups have 100% incentive alignment at all times, the ability for each group to coordinate around their common incentives is critical for them to affect change. If one group can coordinate better than another, it creates power imbalances in their favor. In practice, a major factor is how much coordination can be done on-chain vs. off-chain, where on-chain coordination makes coordinating easier. In some new blockchains (such as Tezos or Polkadot), on-chain coordination allows the rules or even the ledger history itself to be changed. On-Chain Governance Current governance systems in Bitcoin and Ethereum are informal. They were designed using a decentralized ethos, first promulgated by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original paper. Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain are submitted by developers and a core group, consisting mostly of developers, is responsible for coordinating and achieving consensus between stakeholders. The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). What is on-chain governance? On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change. How does it work? Unlike informal governance systems, which use a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems solely work online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code updates. Subsequently, nodes can vote to accept or decline the change. Not all nodes have equal voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a relatively lesser number of holdings. If the change is accepted, it is included in the blockchain and baselined. In some instances of on-chain governance implementation, the updated code may be rolled back to its version before a baseline, if the proposed change is unsuccessful. Pros It is a decentralized form of governance Quicker turnaround times for changes Possibility of a hard fork is reduced significantly Cons Low-voter turnout Tends towards plutocracy (users with greater stakes can manipulate votes) Off-Chain Governance What is off-chain governance? Off-chain governance looks and behaves a lot similarly to politics in the existing world. Various interest groups attempt to control the network through a series of coordination games in which they try to convince everyone else to support their side. There is no code that binds these groups to specific behaviors, but rather, they choose what\u2019s in their best interest given the known preferences of the other stakeholders. There\u2019s a reason blockchain technology and game theory are so interwoven. How does it work?

The stakeholders in this case are miners (who operate nodes), developers (who are responsible for core blockchain algorithms) and users (who use and invest in various coins). The various stakeholders signal their approval or disapproval for an improvement proposal through private and community discourse. Then, the core developers get a sense for whether or not node operators and miners will agree to upgrade their software. Ideally, all sides agree and the code changes are made smoothly. Everything is announced beforehand and stakeholders have time to update. In the case of disagreement, stakeholders have two options. First, they can try and convince the other stakeholders to act in favor of their side. If they can\u2019t reach consensus, they have the ability to hard fork the protocol and keep or change features they think are necessary.

Summary Ether (ETH or \u039e) is the native cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network and is used to compensate miners who secure transactions. A planned upgrade to the Ethereum protocol in 2019-2021 would replace mining with a less computationally expensive Proof of Stake mechanism which will be secured by validators, who are also expected to receive a proportional compensation in Ether. Ether also has many current use cases, such as a store of value (e.g. in lending collateral), a medium of exchange (e.g. in trade and payments), and a unit of account (e.g. in digital marketplaces). Ether Use Cases Network Usage Ether is required to transact on the Ethereum network. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is the unit used to measure the computational power required to process a transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners are expected to be compensated for this task. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21,000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Store of Value Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors. It is used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions, including: used to pay Ethereum transaction fees (in the form of \u2018gas\u2019), used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications (MakerDAO, Compound), can be lent or borrowed (Dharma), accepted as payment by certain retailers and service providers use it as a medium of exchange to purchase Ethereum-based tokens (via ICOs or exchanges), crypto-collectibles, in-game items, and other non-fungible tokens (NFTs) earned as a reward for completing bounties (Gitcoin, Bounties Network). Furthermore, in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity), users will be able to become a validator and help secure the network by providing computational resources and locking up 32 Ether per validator. Due to this, it is expected that Proof of Stake will lock a substantial amount of the circulating supply of Ether. There are also discussions around introducing a \u2018fee-burn\u2019 model where a percentage of Ether used to pay transaction fees would be \u2018burned\u2019 and thus reduce the circulating supply of Ether. In addition to utility value, Ether also has speculative value. This is value that is derived from speculative activities (such as trading and investing) which currently accounts for most of the value behind all crypto-assets. As observed in 2017, crypto-assets can attract substantial speculative interest, with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months. This speculative interest often brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals, but it can be damaging to the short-term market sentiment of all crypto-assets. Can\u2019t tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether? Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called \u2018economic abstraction\u2019 (a good primer can be found here . This would involve miners / validators accepting tokens other than Ether in exchange for adding valid transactions to new blocks. It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it could potentially reduce the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of Ether. How does valuable Ether help to secure the network? In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work (in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations (commonly referred to as \u201cmining farms\u201d) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network (once it reaches a certain size). Miners can also join \u2018mining pools\u2019 in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards. It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack or take control of either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains When Ethereum transitions to Proof of stake under Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that users will be able to stake 32 Ether per validator and receive rewards for their work in the form of additional Ether (at a dynamic issuance rate , discussed later in this essay). Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be tied to the cost of Ether. Instead of using energy intensive mining (as it is under Proof of Work), validators will \u201cstake\u201d Ether, and will lose part or all of their stake if they attempt to behave fraudulently. The more validators with staked Ether securing the network, the more Ether an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack. Such an attack would likely rapidly increase the price of Ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker. Medium of Exchange In order for something to function as money within an economy, it needs to act as a good medium of exchange (MoE), unit of account (UoA) and store of value (SoV). Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy for a wide range of apps, with dApp providers accepting it in exchange for fungible / non-fungible tokens, or other services. It is also used as a unit of account by various parties (including companies that have raised Ether via ICOs). Finally, Ether has historically been used as a store of value, with investors and speculators purchasing Ether to hold for investment purposes, given its relative scarcity, predictable supply growth, and inherent utility. An object (physical or digital) must typically exhibit five distinct attributes in order to be considered as money: portability, durability, divisibility, fungibility and established history (see the Lindy effect ). Ether is highly portable (because it\u2019s digital), durable (again, because it\u2019s digital), divisible (up to 18 decimal places), but has limited fungibility as ETH tokens are interchangeable with one another, but accounts/addresses can be blacklisted quite easily. Privacy protocols such as zk-SNARKs will eventually improve this property for Ethereum. Ethereum has been in operation since 2015 and continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network (and Ether) have functioned as expected for 99.99% of its life. The other 0.01% includes surviving The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a recent 94% drop in price). On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permission-less, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks. The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0). In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it may dilute the value of Ether for those that are not validators. Though, this is offset by Ether being taken out of the circulating supply through staking, various open finance applications, fee burning, and people simply losing access to their Ether.

And surprisingly, it's actually not so hard in Ethereum development to get started with it! The Truffle framework makes it very easy to test contracts with Solidity and JS. Beware: while you can test contracts in Solidity, I highly advise you don't. The tooling is very nascent, and Solidity itself has very few libraries already - you won't be able to load test data (fixtures) from files for example, since Solidity doesn't have an FS API like JS/Node does. for unit testing simple functions, Solidity comes in handy. However you might find using Remix IDE just as quick for accomplishing this to start with (although you won't reap the benefits of having a test later when your code breaks ;)). Running a persistent test blockchain A persistent chain is often useful when you want to test a frontend UI, and you need to persist the data you've transacted onto a blockchain. You can use Ganache (n\u00e9e testrpc) CLI to do this: ganache-cli -d --db ./ganache --gasPrice 1 --gasLimit 10000000 --networkId 123 -u 0 -u 1 This will persist data to ./ganache and most importantly set the network ID (otherwise this is generated from system time on startup, and is not 'persistent' otherwise). Connecting MetaMask with your test blockchain wallets When you run Ganache CLI, it will list private keys on first launch in hex form. You can import these into Metamask and then access your 100 ETH issued by default. Gas You will probably encounter issues with gas. Note that contracts cannot be bigger than 24,000 bytes, and transactions no bigger than 32kb ( source ). Contract creations take gas, which you can estimate with estimateGas . Gas is the internal Ethereum unit for pricing computation, and is converted at a fixed rate to Ether (set by clients), termed the gasPrice . It is measured in the smallest unit, which is gwei. The gasLimit is the maximum amount of gas that can be used in one setting. An example of some gas arithmetic: estimateGas(YourContract) => 286056 # if we run a test blockchain with a gas price of 2 (2 units for 1 gwei) ganache-cli --gasLimit 100000000000 --gasPrice 2 then the minimum amount to send with the transaction is: 286056 * 2 = 572,112 gwei 0.000572112 ETH You might be tempted to set gasLimit to something like 1000000000000000 . This will break Metamask, as it can't encode that value into 53 bits for BigNumber ( see here ). Gas Units Unit Amount per ETH ETH 1 Finney 1,000 Szabo 1,000,000 Gwei 1,000,000,000 Mwei 1,000,000,000,000 Kwei 1,000,000,000,000,000 Wei 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Debugging Testing is important, but you will never ascertain as much information as to the execution of a contract as by using the official debugger tooling, the Remix IDE ( demo , docs ). Remix is a bit of a hack piece put together, but it works very well once you're using it correctly. It can run Solidity in a JavaScript VM, an injected Web3 provider (e.g. Metamask) or connect to your local Ganache / other setup on http://localhost:8545 . Using Remix like a pro Remix is a web app, so it doesn't have access to your file system (whether you access it from remix.ethereum.org or as an Electron desktop app). While you can copy-paste code in, it's much better to install remixd , which will expose a local folder to Remix. Install it globally and save the dep - npm install -g -S remixd Add this to your package.json . javascript { \"scripts\": { \"remix\": \"remixd -s .\", } } Run yarn remix remixd knows to look into node_modules for imported contracts (e.g. SafeMath) from packages like OpenZeppelin, so we run it in our project root . rather than in ./contracts as you might assume. Unit testing Unit testing is for testing individual functions of your contracts. Integration testing Integration testing generally requires multiple interactions from various users/contracts. Since this requires the use of multiple addresses, it is unsuitable to accomplish in Solidity as above. Exposing contracts You may encounter difficulty testing contracts due to the (in)visibility of methods/types, the lack of insertion point for validating data being returned, and so on. It is possible to test not the contract itself, but a wrapped contract for testing purposes only. contract Market { uint[] private orders; function doSomething() {} } How would we access Market.orders here? contract MarketForTesting is Market { function getOrdersCount() public returns (uint8) { return orders.length; } } Testing return values When you call a method on a contract, and it updates state (i.e. is not view / pure ), it must be transacted upon the network. In such case, the Web3 interfaces do not give you the return value of the method. This can be frustrating if you're trying to test such a value, so you can do something like so: async function txWithReturnValue(method, ...args) { let [retval, tx] = await Promise.all([ method.call(...args), method.sendTransaction(...args) ]); return retval; } await txWithReturnValue(Contract.method, 1, \"0x123\", { from: \"0x12312\", value: 2 }); Testing with various 'users' You will want to test the contract's interaction from the POV of multiple users with different addresses (whether it be human or other contracts). This is quite easy to achieve. Whenever you transact with a contract in calling a method, you have the option to specify the from address of who will be funding the tx. Below is a Truffle test which combines this with access to accounts , which is the same output as web3.personal.getListAccounts: const MyContract = artifacts.require(\"./MyContract.sol\"); contract('MyContract', async (accounts) => { it('tests with various users', async () => { let instance = await MyContract.new(); for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { let from = accounts[i]; console.log(`Submitting tx from addr: ${from}`); let txid = await instance.yourMethod.sendTransaction(arg1, arg2, { from, }); } }) })","title":"Ethereum Development Testing - EthHub"},{"location":"ethereum-basics/development/testing/#testing","text":"Not only does Test-Driven Development make your codebase stellar, it's extremely useful when interacting with a new language with different semantics.

There are a couple of key technologies to know about: The main technology used for privacy are called 'zero knowledge proofs'. This technology allows for privacy by mathematically preventing certain information (such as amount, sender, recipient, etc.) from being revealed to the public while the protocol can still guarantee the transaction executes correctly. An older technology called 'Mixers' have some benefits for privacy as well as they serve to obfuscate the data, often making it confusing (or even empirically impossible) to correlate the information correctly. Zero Knowledge-based zk-SNARKs (used in Zcash) zk-STARKs zk-SNARKs are the more studied type of zero-knowledge proof. Due to their widespread usage, the community is reletively certain of their effectiveness. However, they come with a notable downside. zk-SNARKs rely on a polynomial for determining certain computations in the algorithm. If the full factorization of this polynomial is known by someone, then it is trivial for that person to make proofs for that specific zk-SNARK to say incorrect statements. Therefore, it is required that no single person or entity know the entire factorization of the polynomial. The main way this has been achieved is by opening up the polynomial creation process publicly. When Zcash did their last fork, they updated their polynomial and underwent a public polynomial creation (\"powers of tau ceremony\"). If each person privately submits a factor and then destroys that information - so long as a single person in the whole process did it correctly, then no single entity will know the complete factorization. This part is generally called the \"trusted setup\" of a zk-SNARK. So long as you participated, then you can be 100% certain that this issue is not present. There are other studied methods to handle this issue. One of the most interesting is to use a specific type of polynomial that only has complex (imaginary) factors. This prevents there from even existing a factorization which could fool the system. However, it is generally accepted that this method is understudied and needs more research before it is ready to secure significant money. zk-STARKs are a second type of zero-knowledge proof. STARKs rely on slightly different mathematics and dont need a trusted setup. The biggest issue with STARKs is that they require a lot of space (a lot of data for proofs). SNARKs also require a lot of space but more optimizations have been found, making them smaller at the moment. As blockchains are particularly space constrained, the large size of STARKs is a significant issue. There is continued research into reducing the size requirements. But at the moment they are prohibitively large. Both STARKs and SNARKs require a non-0 amount of computation and so if they are to be implemented at large scale, computation can also become a limiting factor. Aztec Protocol is building an efficient zero-knowledge privacy protocol and decentralised exchange. The protocol is already live on Ethereum's mainnet. Starkware Industries is using STARK technology to improve scalability and privacy on Ethereum. Enigma Protocol are building 'secret contracts' which enable computation over encrypted data . Zether is a confidential (transaction amounts are hidden) and anonymous (transaction sender and receiver are hidden) payment mechanism on blockchains with the account model like Ethereum. More info on Zether . Mixers Mixers work a bit differently to zero-knowledge proof technology. In truth, both technologies work by scrambling transactions together. But Mixers only work with transactions happening at that moment by using a set of fake transactions (called \"Mix-ins\") plus several real transactions all which sum to approximated the same number of units of ETH. Basically, when you send a transaction for 5 units of ETH, you need to wait for 1 or 2 other people to also send 5 ETH so that you can scramble all 3 transactions together. Mixers send the outputs to a bunch of addresses with smaller amounts which sum to your original units. This way it can be very confusing to line up who sent what to where when you are actively trying to make transactions look similar. The system works better the more people who are using it at that moment. Tornado is mixer, which uses zk-SNARKS. Heiswap uses stealth addresses and linkable ring signatures .

Vitalik Buterin created a post on EthMagicians calling for more attention towards privacy solutions: Mixers We can encourage the development of easy-to-use, and importantly decentralized (ie. not just \u201ctrustless\u201d, completely serverless) mixers targeting privacy-preserving transfer of small amounts of ETH, so if you want to send gas payment to another account you can do so without linking the two. Note that here, one major challenge with (eg. ringsig or zk snark based) smart contract mixers is that if you want to send funds from A to B, B still needs to have ETH to pay gas to submit the proof to receive their funds, and sending that gas would be a privacy leak; this can be solved with a layer-2 protocol where a user can broadcast their proof (including a commitment to what address they want to receive to and what fee they are willing to pay) over something like Whisper, and a specialized set of nodes could accept these proofs, include them into a transaction and pay for the gas, and collect the fee from the recipient.

But then what is the dapp_id? How would that work for multi-contract dapps? Dapp interaction: The most common category here is using ERC20 tokens inside another dapp. What is the workflow by which they would do that? To use KNC on Uniswap, would you first transfer KNC from their \u201cKyber account\u201d to your \u201cUniswap account\u201d and then do whatever you wanted to do with Uniswap? Something else? Ideally from a UX point of view, it would still feel like the user makes one operation; the UX of dapps that requires users to sign three transactions in a row to do something honestly really sucks.\" Resources: Master ZKP Reading List Private DAI transactions on Ethereum using Zk-SNARKs Explain Like I\u2019m 5: Zero Knowledge Proof","title":"Privacy on Ethereum - EthHub"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/privacy/#privacy","text":"","title":"Privacy"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/privacy/#summary","text":"Privacy on Ethereum is being actively worked on by a number of different teams.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/privacy/#there-are-a-couple-of-key-technologies-to-know-about","text":"The main technology used for privacy are called 'zero knowledge proofs'. This technology allows for privacy by mathematically preventing certain information (such as amount, sender, recipient, etc.) from being revealed to the public while the protocol can still guarantee the transaction executes correctly. An older technology called 'Mixers' have some benefits for privacy as well as they serve to obfuscate the data, often making it confusing (or even empirically impossible) to correlate the information correctly.","title":"There are a couple of key technologies to know about:"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/privacy/#zero-knowledge-based","text":"zk-SNARKs (used in Zcash) zk-STARKs zk-SNARKs are the more studied type of zero-knowledge proof. Due to their widespread usage, the community is reletively certain of their effectiveness. However, they come with a notable downside. zk-SNARKs rely on a polynomial for determining certain computations in the algorithm. If the full factorization of this polynomial is known by someone, then it is trivial for that person to make proofs for that specific zk-SNARK to say incorrect statements. Therefore, it is required that no single person or entity know the entire factorization of the polynomial. The main way this has been achieved is by opening up the polynomial creation process publicly. When Zcash did their last fork, they updated their polynomial and underwent a public polynomial creation (\"powers of tau ceremony\"). If each person privately submits a factor and then destroys that information - so long as a single person in the whole process did it correctly, then no single entity will know the complete factorization. This part is generally called the \"trusted setup\" of a zk-SNARK. So long as you participated, then you can be 100% certain that this issue is not present. There are other studied methods to handle this issue. One of the most interesting is to use a specific type of polynomial that only has complex (imaginary) factors. This prevents there from even existing a factorization which could fool the system. However, it is generally accepted that this method is understudied and needs more research before it is ready to secure significant money. zk-STARKs are a second type of zero-knowledge proof. STARKs rely on slightly different mathematics and dont need a trusted setup. The biggest issue with STARKs is that they require a lot of space (a lot of data for proofs). SNARKs also require a lot of space but more optimizations have been found, making them smaller at the moment. As blockchains are particularly space constrained, the large size of STARKs is a significant issue. There is continued research into reducing the size requirements. But at the moment they are prohibitively large. Both STARKs and SNARKs require a non-0 amount of computation and so if they are to be implemented at large scale, computation can also become a limiting factor.

of information hiding. This increases the ability of a computer system to be used at a higher level with less knowledge of the processes going on underneath. Consider the software developer. A high level programming language is used to create virtual interactions between objects. The programmer does not need to know how to write the 1's and 0's that compose the machine code that runs physically in the memory and processor. This is an example of data abstraction. On the Ethereum network there are currently two types of accounts. External accounts are wallets from which cryptocurrency is transacted in send and receive functions that exist outside of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Contract accounts are \"smart contracts\" that exist in the EVM. The EVM is a virtual computer that exists on the Ethereum blockchain. A series of OPCODES have been hard programmed into the Ethereum blockchain to be able to act as a virtual machine; memory, storage, and processing in the execution of smart contracts. Ethereum account abstraction has the goal of reducing from two account types down to one, a contract account. The single account type will have the functionality to transact both coin and contract. Developer and user will no longer need to make a distinction between account type since transacting will be moved fully into the EVM and off of the blockchain protocol. Account abstraction is going to be an Ethereum 2.0 implementation and there is still fierce debate about the methodology in so doing. Possible Implementation Methods As described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin Lazy full abstraction How it works: the only type of account is a contract. There is one transaction type, which has the following fields: [gas, addr, data]. Executing the transaction consists of playing a message, with msg.sender being some standard \u201cENTRY_POINT\u201d address (eg. 0xff\u2026ff), msg.to being the addr, and the gas and data being the provided values. Users are expected to store funds in contract accounts, where the code of the contract interprets the provided data as an ABI encoding of [nonce, signature, gasprice, value, data], verifies the nonce and signature, pays gas to the miner, sends a message to the desired address with the desired value, and then asks for a refund for the remaining gas. Pros: makes the protocol very simple. apply_tx becomes a very trivial wrapper around apply_msg. Cons: requires fairly complex code inside of each account to verify the nonce and signature and pay gas. Second, requires fairly complex code in the miner to determine what transactions actually are guaranteed to pay for gas. Third, it requires additional logic for the sender and the miner to create new accounts. Finally, it introduces the possibility that, with accounts constructed in a \u201cnon-standard\u201d way, a transaction with the same hash could get included multiple times. The miner\u2019s problem is as follows. The miner needs to verify, in O(1) time, that a given transaction actually is guaranteed to pay for gas if the miner decides to process the transaction and try to include it in the block. In an abstraction system, this could involve asking the miner to run some code, say, with a limit of 200000 gas, but the miner would need to be sure that, after this happens, the transaction execution is in a state where the gas is paid for, and the payment cannot be reverted. Currently, the protocol handles this automatically; in full abstraction, this must all be implemented in code, and possibly in a fairly complex way. Remove nonce abstraction How it works: same as above, except a transaction also has a nonce field. A rule is added that a transaction\u2019s nonce must equal the account nonce, and that the nonce is incremented upon a successful transaction. Pros: removes the possibility of a transaction appearing in multiple places. Cons: increases base protocol complexity slightly, and remove the possibility of alternative schemes (eg. UTXOs, parallelizable nonces) Standardize signature scheme How it works: add a byte-array field sig to the transaction. In the top-level message, add to the transaction\u2019s return data sighash ++ sig, where sighash is the sha3 of the transaction not including the sig. Pros: makes signature verification much simpler. Cons: increases base protocol complexity slightly. Add BREAKPOINT opcode How it works: add an opcode BREAKPOINT, which has the property that if a transaction throws after a breakpoint, it only reverts up to the breakpoint. Pros: makes it much easier for the miner to detect if a transaction pays for gas; the miner\u2019s code would only need to be something like \u201crun for N steps or until a breakpoint, see that the breakpoint has been reached, and that gas has been paid for\u201d. Cons: deep and fundamental change to the EVM. Historically not the best idea. Add PAYGAS opcode How it works: takes as input one argument (gasprice), immediately transfers the gasprice * tx.gas to a temporary account, and then at the end of executing the transaction refunds any unused gas. Pros: makes paying for gas simpler, and particularly does not require the transaction to include merkle branches to process a call to the coinbase. Avoids the overhead of a call to the coinbase. Cons: increases base protocol complexity. Also does not allow abstracting gas payment, eg. paying with ERC20 tokens. Gasprice + PANIC How it works: a transaction adds a parameter gasprice. At the start of execution, gasprice * startgas is subtracted. A PANIC opcode is added, which can only be called in a top-level execution context (ie. if msg.sender == ENTRY_POINT) and where (tx.gas - msg.gas) <= PANICLIMIT (eg. PANICLIMIT = 200000). If this opcode is triggered, then the entire transaction is invalid. A user account would make sure to check the signature and nonce within the limit, preventing invalid transactions from consuming gas. Miners would run transactions with a sufficient gasprice and reject those that panic. Pros: account code is simple, and miner code is simple, while still adding full signature and nonce abstraction Cons: increases base protocol complexity slightly. Also does not allow abstracting gas payment, eg. paying with ERC20 tokens. Third, does not provide flexibility in how much time signature verification can take (though Casper already enforces a limit, so the limit can be set to be the same value). One possible variant is to simply make the transaction invalidity behavior be part of the behavior of THROW if called in a top-level context with the given amount of remaining gas. Combine PANIC and PAYGAS How it works: remove PANIC. Instead, have all exceptions have behavior equivalent to PANIC if PAYGAS has not yet been called. Pros: allows accounts to set their own base verification gas limit. A miner can run the algorithm of running the code for up to N gas, where N is chosen by the miner, until PAYGAS has been called. Also, removes the need for gasprice to be part of the transaction body. Cons: makes the output state of a message slightly more complicated, as it also needs to carry the information of whether or not a PAYGAS opcode was triggered and if so with what gasprice. Salt + code in transaction How it works: a transaction has two new fields: salt and code. If the target account of a transaction is nonempty, then these two fields must be empty [variant: are ignored]. If the target account is empty, then the last 20 bytes of sha3(salt + code) must equal the account, and if this is the case then the code is put into that position in the account code [variant: is used as init code]. Pros: creates a standard and clean way to create new accounts. Cons: adds protocol complexity. Newly created account pays How it works: a transaction can be a contract creation transaction by specifying a salt and code. If the target address is empty, then it takes funds from that address to pay for gas, and then creates the contract. Pros: similar to existing contract creation. Cons: sending the first transaction from an account takes an additional step. Minimally Simple Account Abstraction without Gas refunds As described by Ethereum co-founder Vitalk Buterin: This is an account abstraction proposal that achieves significantly greater simplicity, and greater generality, than anything proposed so far, but at a price: transactions whose gas costs are not completely static may end up overcharging gas. The proposal is simple. Add an opcode BREAKPOINT, with the property that a function call that fails after a BREAKPOINT reverts only up to the BREAKPOINT. User account code would in general be structured as follows: verify_nonce() verify_signature() send(coinbase, x) breakpoint() do_stuff() do_more_stuff() After the execution hits the BREAKPOINT opcode, the block proposer is certain that they will get compensated for including the transaction. Note that in this model, refunds for unused gas are not possible. To add more flexibility, add another opcode, DECREASE_LIMIT, which decreases the remaining gas limit without consuming gas. This would allow for account code where the gas limit of a transaction can be determined in the \u201cheader\u201d (ie. before the send and BREAKPOINT). Consequences apply_msg and apply_tx become identical (fee market reform 7 can be done at the per-block level), greatly reducing complexity The ABI would need to specify the max gas consumption of each function call, so that tight maximums can be more easily computed Does not require static analysis of code Would lead to some inefficiency in cases where gas costs truly are variable (the most common use case being CREATE2\u2019ing a contract if and only if it does not exist yet), as the user would need to pay for the higher level of consumption even if the lower level of consumption is more frequent Implements full abstraction, so we would lose the tx hash uniqueness guarantee Security Considerations To pay for the computing resources of nodes and miners and to incentivize the use of efficient code, there is a Gas cost associated with interactions of smart contracts. One of the attack vectors for the Ethereum blockchain is DoS (denial of service) by creating transactions that are computationally intensive. The efforts seen above are intended to be able to charge the correct amount of Gas without allowing an attack vector for DoS.

User account code would in general be structured as follows: verify_nonce() verify_signature() send(coinbase, x) breakpoint() do_stuff() do_more_stuff() After the execution hits the BREAKPOINT opcode, the block proposer is certain that they will get compensated for including the transaction. Note that in this model, refunds for unused gas are not possible. To add more flexibility, add another opcode, DECREASE_LIMIT, which decreases the remaining gas limit without consuming gas.

Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit: Damit das Netzwerk auch bei gro\u00dfen Spaltungen (Forks) oder wenn eine sehr gro\u00dfe Anzahl von Nodes offline geht, stabil und funktionsf\u00e4hig bleibt. Sicherheit: Sodass Crypto- und Designtechniken verwendet werden, die eine gro\u00dfe Anzahl von Validatoren/Nodes insgesamt und per Zeiteinheit erm\u00f6glichen. Einfachheit: Damit die Komplexit\u00e4t minimiert wird, wenn auch auf Kosten einiger Effizienzverluste. Langlebigkeit: Damit alle Komponenten so ausgew\u00e4hlt werden, dass sie entweder direkt Quantensicherheit besitzen oder einfach ausgetauscht werden k\u00f6nnen, wenn quantensichere Komponenten verf\u00fcgbar sind. Phase 0 \u2013 Beacon-Chain Was beinhaltet sie? Phase 0 beinhaltet den Start der sogenannten Beacon-Chain. Die Beacon-Chain verwaltet das \u201eCasper Proof of Stake\u201c-Protokoll f\u00fcr sich selbst und alle Shard-Chains. Wie Ben Edgington es ausdr\u00fcckt : \u201eEs gibt eine Reihe an auszuf\u00fchrenden Aufgaben: Die Verwaltung von Validatoren und deren Stakes/Eins\u00e4tze, die Nominierung des ausgew\u00e4hlten Block-Vorschlagenden f\u00fcr jeden Shard in jedem Schritt, die Organisation von Validatoren in Aussch\u00fcssen zum Abstimmen \u00fcber die vorgeschlagenen Bl\u00f6cke, die Anwendung der Konsensregeln, die Anwendung von Pr\u00e4mien und Strafen f\u00fcr Validatoren und die Funktion als Ankerpunkt, an dem die Shards ihre Status registrieren, um Shard-\u00fcbergreifende-Transaktionen (Cross-Shard-Transaktionen) zu erm\u00f6glichen.\u201c Die prim\u00e4re Quelle der Nutzlast auf der Beacon-Chain werden \u201eBescheinigungen\u201c sein. Bescheinigungen sind Verf\u00fcgbarkeitsabstimmungen f\u00fcr einen Shard-Block und gleichzeitig \u201eProof of Stake\u201c-Abstimmungen f\u00fcr einen Beacon-Block. Eine ausreichende Anzahl von Bescheinigungen f\u00fcr denselben Shard-Block erzeugt einen \u201eCrosslink\u201c, der das Shard-Segment bis zu diesem Shard-Block in die Beacon-Chain best\u00e4tigt. Phase 0 wird Casper das Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) f\u00fcr die Endg\u00fcltigkeit verwenden. Die Endg\u00fcltigkeit bedeutet einfach ausgedr\u00fcckt, dass eine bestimmte Operation nach ihrer Durchf\u00fchrung f\u00fcr immer in der Geschichte der Blockchain festgeschrieben ist und nichts diese Operation r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig machen kann. ETH2: Das neue Ether Phase 0 f\u00fchrt ETH2 ein, ein neues Asset f\u00fcr Staker (Validatoren), das in der Beacon-Chain verwendet wird. Es wird durch zwei Methoden generiert: Als Belohnung f\u00fcr die Validierung der Beacon-Chain (und Shards nach Phase 1). Mit dem Kauf f\u00fcr 1 ETH durch einen ETH1.X-Nutzer \u00fcber einen Registrierungsvertrag . Der Vertrag bezieht sich darauf als Hinterlegung. Derzeit gibt es keine M\u00f6glichkeit, ETH2 in Phase 0 aus der Beacon-Chain abzuheben oder zu \u00fcbertragen. Nach der Einzahlung im ETH1.x Validator-Vertrag wird das ETH1 Asset effektiv verbrannt. Beacon-Chain-Validatoren beobachten diesen Vertrag und \u00fcbermitteln Einlageninformationen an die Beacon-Chain, die dann entsprechend ETH2 an die Einleger ausgibt. Zu guter Letzt wird die Beacon-Chain eine gute Qualit\u00e4t von Zuf\u00e4lligkeit f\u00fcr den Rest des Systems erzeugen (verteilt, \u00fcberpr\u00fcfbar, unvorhersehbar und (angemessen) unparteiisch). Es wird RANDAO verwenden, womit von vielen Teilnehmern bereitgestellte Beitr\u00e4ge (individuelle Zufallszahlen) ganz unkompliziert in einer einzigen Ausgabenummer zusammengefasst werden k\u00f6nnen. Dies wird verwendet, um Validatoren in Block-Vorschl\u00e4ger und Aussch\u00fcsse f\u00fcr Entscheidungen zu organisieren. Wie wird das Netzwerk aussehen? Sobald Phase 0 abgeschlossen ist, wird es zwei aktive Ethereum-Blockchains geben. Der Klarheit halber nennen wir sie die Eth1-Chain (aktuelle, PoW \u00f6ffentliche Blockchain) und die Eth2-Chain (neue Beacon-Chain). W\u00e4hrend dieser Phase k\u00f6nnen Benutzer ihr ETH von der Eth1-Chain in die Eth2-Chain eintauschen und die Rolle von Validatoren einnehmen. Allerdings k\u00f6nnen sie diese ETH (vorl\u00e4ufig) NICHT zur Eth1-Chain zur\u00fcckmigrieren. Ein Grund f\u00fcr diesen Schritt k\u00f6nnte die Auszahlung von Zinsen in ETH in der Eth2-Chain sein. Um die Beacon-Chain ausf\u00fchren zu k\u00f6nnen, brauchst du einen Beacon-Chain-Client. Dieser wird derzeit getrennt von der bekannten Suite von standardm\u00e4\u00dfigen Ethereum-Clients (Geth, Parity, Pantheon, etc.) von einer Reihe von Teams entwickelt. Die meisten Eth2.0-Teams ver\u00f6ffentlichen regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Updates \u00fcber ihren Entwicklungsfortschritt der Clients. Einige Teams bieten Beitragenden Belohnungen an, um mehr und mehr Entwickler in den Aufbau der Eth2.0-Architektur einzubinden. Du kannst f\u00fcr Beitr\u00e4ge hier Gitcoin-Pr\u00e4mien bekommen. Isoliert ist die Beacon-Chain nicht besonders n\u00fctzlich. Aber als erste zu realisierende Komponente von Ethereum 2.0 ist es das Fundament des gesamten zuk\u00fcnftigen Systems. Wichtige \u00dcberlegungen ETH2 ist nach Abschluss der Phase 2 zu und von Shards frei \u00fcbertragbar (jedoch kann sich dies noch in Zukunft \u00e4ndern). Es wird eine Mindestmenge an ETH-Stakes notwendig sein, um die Beacon-Chain zu Beginn zu starten. Dies ist definiert als CHAIN_START_FULL_DEPOSIT_THRESHOLD im Einlagen-Vertrag, der auf der Eth1.0-Blockchain eingerichtet wird . Um ein Validator zu werden, musst du 32 ETH2 staken. W\u00e4hrend der Phase 0 werden alle Transaktionen und Smart-Contract-Berechnungen weiterhin auf der Eth1-Chain laufen. Phase 1 - Shard-Chains Was beinhalten sie? Shard-Chains sind der Schl\u00fcssel zu zuk\u00fcnftiger Skalierbarkeit, da sie einen parallelen Transaktionsdurchsatz erm\u00f6glichen. In Phase 1 werden 64 davon eingesetzt (mit der Option, im Laufe der Zeit mehr hinzuzuf\u00fcgen). Phase 1 befasst sich in erster Linie mit der Konstruktion, G\u00fcltigkeit und dem Konsens der Daten dieser Shard-Chains. Phase 1 gibt weder die Ausf\u00fchrung des Shard-Chain-Zustands noch die Kontost\u00e4nde an. Es erscheint eher wie ein Testlauf f\u00fcr die Sharding-Struktur als ein Versuch, Shards zu skalieren. Die Beacon-Chain behandelt Shard-Chain-Bl\u00f6cke als einfache Ansammlung von Bits ohne Struktur oder Bedeutung. Crosslinks Periodisch wird der aktuelle Zustand (die \u201ekombinierte Datenwurzel\u201c) jedes Shards in einem Beacon-Chain-Block als Querverbindung aufgezeichnet. Wenn der Beacon-Chain Block finalisiert wurde, wird auch der entsprechende Shard Block als finalisiert angesehen, und andere Shards wissen, dass sie sich bei Cross-Shard-Transaktionen auf diesen verlassen k\u00f6nnen. Crosslinks sind eine Reihe von Signaturen eines Ausschusses, die f\u00fcr einen Block in einer Shard-Chain best\u00e4tigt werden und in die Beacon-Chain aufgenommen werden k\u00f6nnen. Crosslinks sind die wichtigsten Verbindungen, mit denen die Beacon-Chain den aktualisierten Zustand der Shard-Chains \"erlernt\". Crosslinks dienen auch als Infrastruktur f\u00fcr asynchrone Cross-Shard Kommunikation. Shard-Validatoren, die von der Beacon-Chain f\u00fcr jeden Shard an jedem Slot zuf\u00e4llig ausgew\u00e4hlt werden, kommen lediglich zu einer Einigung \u00fcber den Inhalt jedes Blocks. Sie best\u00e4tigen den Inhalt und Status des Shards durch das Erstellen von Crosslinks. Es spielt keine Rolle, welche Informationen in Shard-Bl\u00f6cken erscheinen, solange alle Aussch\u00fcsse einen Konsens erzielen und die Beacon-Chain regelm\u00e4\u00dfig aktualisieren. Wie sieht das Netzwerk aus? Die Eth1- und Eth2-Chains werden nach Phase 1 weiterhin parallel laufen. Wichtige \u00dcberlegungen In Phase 0, 1 und 2 bleibt die Main PoW-Chain (Eth1) live, w\u00e4hrend Tests und \u00dcberg\u00e4nge auf der Eth2-Chain stattfinden. Dies bedeutet, dass Belohnungen sowohl an Ethereum 2.0-Validatoren als auch an die normalen PoW-Miner ausgezahlt werden. Daher kann die kombinierte Inflation der beiden Blockchains zun\u00e4chst steigen, jedoch wird sie danach beginnen, sich in Richtung 0-1% zu bewegen, da auf die alte PoW-Blockchain allm\u00e4hlich weniger Wert gelegt wird. Phase 2 - State Execution Was beinhaltet sie? Phase 2 ist der Zeitpunkt, an dem sich die Funktionalit\u00e4t des gesamten Systems vereint. Shard-Chains werden von einfachen Datencontainern in einen strukturierten Kettenzustand \u00fcberf\u00fchrt und Smart-Contracts werden wieder eingef\u00fchrt. Jeder Shard verwaltet eine virtuelle Maschine basierend auf eWASM . Phase 2 unterst\u00fctzt Konten, Vertr\u00e4ge, Zust\u00e4nde und andere Abstraktionen, die wir aus Solidity kennen. Wir k\u00f6nnen erwarten, dass bekannte Werkzeuge wie Truffle, Solc oder Ganache portiert werden, um eWASM vor oder w\u00e4hrend Phase 2 zu unterst\u00fctzen. Phase 2 f\u00fchrt auch das Konzept der Ausf\u00fchrungsumgebungen (Execution Environments, EEs) ein. EEs in einem Shard k\u00f6nnen auf jede Weise konstruiert werden, die ein Entwickler f\u00fcr passend h\u00e4lt. Es k\u00f6nnte eine EE f\u00fcr eine UTXO-Chain geben, ein System im Libra-Stil, eine EE f\u00fcr einen Geb\u00fchren-Markt-Verteiler oder andere. Jeder Shard hat Zugriff auf alle Ausf\u00fchrungsumgebungen und besitzt die M\u00f6glichkeit, Transaktionen in diesen zu t\u00e4tigen sowie Smart-Contracts auszuf\u00fchren und mit ihnen zu interagieren. Beachte, dass sich das Konzept von Ausf\u00fchrungsumgebungen noch immer in intensiver Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeit befindet. Wichtige \u00dcberlegungen Eine dApp muss ausw\u00e4hlen, auf welchem Shard sie sich befinden will. Diese Entscheidung ist wichtig, weil die Cross-Shard Kommunikation in Eth2 unterschiedlich ist, da sie nicht synchron ist, was wiederum bedeutet, dass zwischen den Shards eine gewisse Flexibilit\u00e4t verloren geht Eine dApp m\u00fcsste ziemlich gro\u00dfe Datenmengen beinhalten, um alle Ressourcen in einem gegebenen Shard zu verbrauchen und damit das Ausbreiten auf mehrere Shards zu rechtfertigen. Diese Phase stattet Shards mit eWASM als EVM 2.0 aus. Es bleibt offen, wann und wie Ethereum 1.0-Konten und -Vertr\u00e4ge auf Ethereum 2.0 migriert werden. Es gibt einige Upgrade-Pl\u00e4ne Wie geht es weiter? Die Sharding-Roadmap schl\u00e4gt nach dem offiziellen Wiki 6 Phasen vor. Ethereum-Forscher Justin Drake ist der festen \u00dcberzeugung, dass die Sharding Phase 1 und 2 in den Jahren 2020 und 2021 erfolgen wird (vorausgesetzt, dass die Beacon-Chain Anfang 2020 startet). Ab Phase 3 ist jede Art der Vorhersage Spekulation, da sich voraussichtlich viel ver\u00e4ndern wird. Du kannst dir das wiki ansehen, um weitere Informationen zu erhalten.

Fase 0 - Cadeia de Beacon O que est\u00e1 inclu\u00eddo Fase 0 \u00e9 o nome dado para o lan\u00e7amento da Cadeia de Beacon. A Cadeia de Beacon gerenciar\u00e1 o protocolo de Proof of Stake Casper e todas as suas cadeias de fragmentos. Como Ben Edgington escreve , \"H\u00e1 uma s\u00e9rie de aspectos para isso: gerenciar validadores e suas participa\u00e7\u00f5es; nomeando o bloco escolhido proponente para cada fragmento em cada etapa; organizando validadores em comit\u00eas para votar nos blocos propostos; aplica\u00e7\u00e3o das regras de consenso; aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de recompensas e san\u00e7\u00f5es aos validadores; e, ser um ponto de refer\u00eancia em que os fragmentos registam os seus estados para facilitar transa\u00e7\u00f5es cruzadas.\u201d A fonte prim\u00e1ria de carga na Cadeia de Beacon ser\u00e1 \"atesta\u00e7\u00f5es\". Atesta\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o votos dispon\u00edveis para um bloco de fragmentos e, simultaneamente, provas de pontos de interesse para um bloco de beacon. Um n\u00famero suficiente de atesta\u00e7\u00f5es para o mesmo bloco de fragmentos ir\u00e1 criar um \"cruzamento\" que confirma o segmento do fragmento at\u00e9 aquele bloco de fragmento na Cadeia de Beacon. A Fase 0 ir\u00e1 usar o Gadget de Finalidade Amig\u00e1vel (Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget - FFG) para esta finalidade. A finalidade, em termos muito vagos, significa que, uma vez conclu\u00edda uma determinada opera\u00e7\u00e3o, esta ficar\u00e1 para sempre gravado na hist\u00f3ria e nada pode reverter essa opera\u00e7\u00e3o. ETH2: O Novo Ether Fase 0 ir\u00e1 introduzir o ETH2 que ser\u00e1 um novo ativo para acionistas (validadores) para ser usado na Cadeia de Beacon. Ele ser\u00e1 criado utilizando dois m\u00e9todos: Como recompensa por validar a Cadeia de Beacon (e fragmentos ap\u00f3s a Fase 1). Compr\u00e1-lo para 1 ETH por qualquer usu\u00e1rio ETH1.X atrav\u00e9s de um contrato de registro . O contrato refere-se a ele como um dep\u00f3sito. Atualmente n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma maneira de retirar ou transferir ETH2 da Cadeia de Sinalizador na Fase 0. Uma vez depositado no contrato de registo de validador ETH1.x, o ETH1 \u00e9 efetivamente queimado. Os validadores da Cadeia de Beacons assistem a este contrato e enviam informa\u00e7\u00f5es de dep\u00f3sito \u00e0 Cadeia de Beacons, que ent\u00e3o emitem ETH2 aos depositantes. Por \u00faltimo, a Cadeia de Beacon ir\u00e1 gerar uma boa qualidade (distribu\u00edda, verific\u00e1vel, imprevis\u00edvel e (razoavelmente) aleat\u00f3ria) para o resto do sistema. Ela usar\u00e1 RANDAO que \u00e9 simplesmente uma maneira de combinar contribui\u00e7\u00f5es (n\u00fameros aleat\u00f3rios individuais) fornecidas por muitos participantes em um \u00fanico n\u00famero de sa\u00edda. Isso ser\u00e1 usado para organizar validadores em proponentes e comites de blocos. Como ser\u00e1 a rede? Quando a Fase 0 estiver completa, haver\u00e1 duas cadeias Ethereum ativas. Por uma quest\u00e3o de clareza, vamos cham\u00e1-las de rede ETH1 (atual, rede principal usando PoW) e de ETH2 (a nova rede de Cadeia de Beacons). Durante esta fase, os usu\u00e1rios poder\u00e3o migrar seu ETH da rede Eth1 para a rede de Eth2 e tornar-se validadores. No entanto, eles N\u00c3O conseguir\u00e3o migrar estes ETH de volta (por enquanto). A raz\u00e3o pela qual algu\u00e9m pode querer fazer isto \u00e9 porque ele pode ganhar juros pagos pelo ETH na rede de Eth2. Para executar a Cadeia de Beacons, voc\u00ea vai precisar de um cliente da rede da Cadeia de Beacons. Estes est\u00e3o sendo desenvolvidos separadamente do conjunto de clientes Ethereum padr\u00e3o (Geth, Parity, Pantheon, etc) por um n\u00famero de equipes . A maioria das equipes est\u00e1 publicando atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es peri\u00f3dicas sobre o progresso do desenvolvimento de seus clientes e algumas das equipes est\u00e3o oferecendo recompensas aos colaboradores para incluir cada vez mais desenvolvedores na constru\u00e7\u00e3o do Ethereum 2.0 . Voc\u00ea pode contribuir com doa\u00e7\u00f5es no Gitcoin aqui Por si s\u00f3, a Cadeia de Beacons pode n\u00e3o parecer particularmente \u00fatil. Mas, como primeiro componente da Ethereum 2.0 a ser entregue, \u00e9 a base de todo o sistema. Considera\u00e7\u00f5es importantes ETH2 \u00e9 transfer\u00edvel para e de fragmentos assim que a Fase 2 estiver completa (embora isso possa mudar no futuro). Haver\u00e1 uma quantidade m\u00ednima de ETH em dep\u00f3sito necess\u00e1ria para a inicializa\u00e7\u00e3o inicial da cadeia de sinalizadores. Isto \u00e9 definido como CHAIN_START_FUL_DEPOSIT_THRESHOLD no contrato de dep\u00f3sito que estar\u00e1 ativo na rede Eth 1.0 . Para se tornar um validador, voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 depositar 32 ETH2. Durante a fase 0, todas as transa\u00e7\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rio e computa\u00e7\u00e3o de contratos inteligentes ainda ocorrer\u00e3o na rede Eth1. Fase 1 - Cadeias de Fragmento O que est\u00e1 inclu\u00eddo As cadeias de fragmentos s\u00e3o chave para a futura escalabilidade j\u00e1 que permitem transa\u00e7\u00f5es em paralelo, e haver\u00e1 64 delas implantadas na Fase 1 (com a op\u00e7\u00e3o de adicionar mais ao longo do tempo). A fase 1 est\u00e1 principalmente preocupada com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o, validade e consenso sobre os dados destas cadeias de fragmentos. Fase 1 n\u00e3o especifica o estado da execu\u00e7\u00e3o da cadeia de fragmentos ou os saldos da conta. Ser\u00e1 como uma execu\u00e7\u00e3o experimental para a estrutura de compartilhamento ao inv\u00e9s de uma tentativa de usar fragmentos em escala. A Cadeia de Beacon tratar\u00e1 os blocos da cadeia de fragmentos como simples cole\u00e7\u00f5es de bits sem estrutura ou significado. Crosslinks Periodicamente, o estado atual (a \"combina\u00e7\u00e3o de dados root\") de cada fragmento \u00e9 gravado em um bloco de Cadeia de Beacon como uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o cruzada. Quando o bloco de Cadeia de Beacon for finalizado, o bloco de fragmento correspondente \u00e9 considerado finalizado, e outros fragmentos sabem que podem confiar nisso para transa\u00e7\u00f5es cruzadas. Links cruzados s\u00e3o um conjunto de assinaturas de um comite atestando um bloco em uma cadeia de fragmentos que pode ser inclu\u00eddo na Cadeia de Beacon. Links cruzados s\u00e3o os principais meios pelos quais a Cadeia de Beacon \"aprende sobre\" o estado atualizado das cadeias de fragmentos. Os Links Cruzados tamb\u00e9m servem como infraestrutura para uma comunica\u00e7\u00e3o ass\u00edncrona entre cadeias de fragmentos. Validadores da cadeia de fragmentos, que s\u00e3o selecionados aleatoriamente pela Cadeia de Beacons para cada fragmento em cada segmento, meramente chegam a um acordo sobre o conte\u00fado de cada bloco. Eles atestam o conte\u00fado e o estado atrav\u00e9s de uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o cruzada. N\u00e3o importa qual informa\u00e7\u00e3o aparece nos blocos de fragmentos, desde que todas as comiss\u00f5es cheguem a consenso e atualizem a Cadeia de Beacon no fragmento regularmente. Como ser\u00e1 a rede? As cadeias Eth1 e Eth2 ainda funcionar\u00e3o em paralelo ap\u00f3s a fase 1. Considera\u00e7\u00f5es importantes Na fase 0, 1 e 2, a rede principal PoW (Eth1) continuar\u00e1 ativa enquanto se realizam testes e a transi\u00e7\u00e3o estiver ocorrendo para a rede Eth2. Isto significa que as recompensas ser\u00e3o pagas aos validadores do Ethereum 2.0, bem como as recompensas normais de blocos PoW. Por conseguinte, a infla\u00e7\u00e3o combinada das duas cadeias pode disparar inicialmente, mas depois come\u00e7ar\u00e1 a ter tend\u00eancia para a faixa dos 0-1%, \u00e0 medida que a cadeia PoW for gradualmente \"desenfatizada\". Fase 2 - Execu\u00e7\u00e3o do estado O que est\u00e1 inclu\u00eddo? A Fase 2 \u00e9 onde a funcionalidade de todo o sistema come\u00e7ar\u00e1 a reunir-se. A transi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma cadeia de fragmentos de simples containers de dados para uma cadeia de dados estruturados e com Contratos Inteligentes ser\u00e1 reintroduzida. Cada fragmento ir\u00e1 gerenciar uma m\u00e1quina virtual baseada em eWASM . Ele suportar\u00e1 contas, contratos, estado e outras abstra\u00e7\u00f5es que estamos familiarizados do Solidity. Podemos esperar ferramentas familiares como truffle, solc, ganache portado para suportar o eWASM antes ou durante a fase 2. A Fase 2 tamb\u00e9m introduz o conceito de 'Ambientes de Execu\u00e7\u00e3o' (EEs). EEs dentro de um fragmento podem ser constru\u00eddos da forma que um desenvolvedor considerar adequada - pode haver um EE para uma cadeia de estilo UTXO, um sistema ao estilo Libra, um EE para um fornecedor de taxas de mercado e al\u00e9m. Todo fragmento tem acesso a todos os ambientes de execu\u00e7\u00e3o e tem a capacidade de fazer transa\u00e7\u00f5es dentro deles, al\u00e9m de executar e interagir com contratos inteligentes. Observe que o conceito de ambiente de execu\u00e7\u00e3o ainda est\u00e1 em grande an\u00e1lise e desenvolvimento. Considera\u00e7\u00f5es importantes Um dApp ter\u00e1 que escolher em qual fragmento quer estar. Essa decis\u00e3o \u00e9 importante porque a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o cruzada difere no Eth2, uma vez que n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00edncrona, o que significa que se perde alguma composabilidade entre fragmentos Um dApp teria que ter dados bastante grandes para consumir todos os recursos em um dado fragmento para justificar se espalhar por v\u00e1rios deles. Esta fase vai dar fragmentos com eWASM como o EVM 2.0. \u00c9 uma pergunta em aberto quando e como as contas e contratos da Ethereum 1.0 ser\u00e3o migrados para a Ethereum 2.0. Existem alguns planos de atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o O que vem depois? O roteiro da cadeia de fragmentos de acordo com a wiki oficial sugere 6 fases. O pesquisador Justin Drake acredita firmemente que as fases de compartilhamento 1 e 2 vir\u00e3o em 2020 e 2021, respectivamente (assumindo que a Cadeia do Beacon inicia no come\u00e7o de 2020).

A blockchain is defined as a \"cryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.\" \"Cryptographically secure\" means that creation and movement of the digital currency is mathematically obscured by extremely complex algorithms nearly impossible to decode. \"Transaction singleton machine\" means a single canonical instance of the machine is being created in the system to handle transactions. This is a singular truth that all participants on the network believe in. \"With shared-state\" means that the state of the machine is stored and shared with everyone. This is an examination of the concept of state in a virtual machine which introduces the concept of a stateless client in Ethereum. What does state mean? State defines the values contained in a block at any given time. The state of the virtual machine changes after each set of transactions are processed. State-defining Objects Account State The global \"shared-state\" is comprised of many objects called accounts. Two types of accounts exist, externally owned and contract accounts. Externally owned accounts are controlled by private keys and have no code associate with them. Contract accounts are controlled by their contract code and have code associated with them. Account state is further broken down into: nonce: For externally owned accounts this refers to number of transactions sent from the address. Contract accounts would store the number of contracts created by the account. balance: The amount of Ether stored on the account. storageRoot: A hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia tree. This encodes a hash of storage contents on the account. codeHash: The hash of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) code of this account. Contract account code gets hashed and stored here. Externally owned accounts contain the hash of an empty string. World State World state is a mapping of account addresses between account states. This mapping is stored as a Merkle Patricia tree. This same structure is used to store transactions and receipts. This becomes a large amount of data which needs to be stored and processed if the entire state is stored and traversed when creating new blocks. Ethereum Stateless Client The way a block is constructed on Ethereum offers a method to create a sort of stateless client. It is important to know that as Ethereum evolves, statelessness is ultimately going to be a spectrum. Some knowledge of data in surrounding nodes will be required in order to create valid hashes. Statelessness allows the creation of light nodes. A light node contains only the chain of headers without the execution of any transactions or associated states. When a node comes online it will be fully stateless since it will hold zero information regarding state. Over time it will soak up the state as transactions touch upon it, putting together a more complete state with every change of state presented. New nodes will be more stateless offering benefits of lower memory usage, disk, and I/O. Bandwidth usage will be the highest because peers need to send larger proofs to the new node as it develops its own state data. More stateful clients will have higher demands on memory, disk, and I/O while bandwidth requirements would decrease. Nodes can become more stateful until a certain tradeoff point is reached and then halted from further acquisition of state information to optimize the trade off in computing power and bandwidth. Applications of Stateless Clients in Ethereum Ethereum 1.X implements stateless clients but not stateless miners. Fast sync initializes as a stateless node. It creates what is called a launch-block and only records the input and output state of this block locally. The launch block is a predetermined block number that is a certain amount of time in the future. The future dated deadline is so that the node can work on constructing the launch-block. Witness data is called by the node to construct blocks. As long as the launch-block is created early or on time, the creation of blocks will continue and the node is active. Use of witness data and input/output states only make this a stateless client. Ethereum 2.0 implements stateless clients and stateless miners in Sharding. All nodes are stateless so that faster processing with less data increases scalability greatly. Currently the Ethereum blockchain is a sequential chain of blocks where one is completed on top of another in a linear fashion. This leads to traffic jams and an overall inefficency in data processing. Sharding is a design where the Ethereum network is split into groups referred to a shards. Each shard has its own independant state. Transactions are delegated to different shards for processing, so rather than the entire network processing the same transaction, parallel computing increases efficiency by allowing the work to be split up and executed concurrently. Additional Benefits of Stateless Clients Mining new blocks will be moved from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS). A user can become a miner by staking a minimum amount of Ethereum live on the blockchain. This allows a miner to vote on the next block to create. Consensus comes very quickly, within one block of the evaluated block, because lengthy hash cryptography is no longer used to create blocks. This greatly reduces electricity requirements, therefore cost of running a node. Additionally, the held stake is an economic incentive / punishement for any miner that performs nefarious activity. Disk I/O becomes less susceptable to DoS attacks, however still remains the best vector for a DoS attack. Even for state-storing clients, the account lists allow clients to pre-fetch storage data from disk, possibly in parallel, greatly reducing their vulnerability to DoS attacks. In a sharded blockchain, security is increased by reshuffling clients between shards frequently. In a state-storing client model, reshuffling involved clients download the full state of the new shard they are being reshuffled to. In a stateless client, this cost drops to zero, allowing clients to be reshuffled between every single block that they create. Transaction speed and scalablility will also improve. Security Considerations DoS attacks aimed at the disk I/O vector are still the greatest risk for DoS attacks. Casper is the proof of staking algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0.

Transaction speed and scalablility will also improve.","title":"Additional Benefits of Stateless Clients"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/stateless-clients/#security-considerations","text":"DoS attacks aimed at the disk I/O vector are still the greatest risk for DoS attacks.

Commit-chains are the generic term for what is also called 'Plasma' - a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum and other blockchains. Vitalik Buterin has jokingly said, \"Commit chains\" is more on-brand for bitcoin whereas \"plasma\" is more on-brand for ethereum. Commit-chains, also sometimes described as non-custodial side chains, don\u2019t introduce a new consensus mechanism like side chains - they rely on the parent-blockchains consensus which makes them as safe as the parent-blockchain itself. In commit-chains, untrusted and non-custodial operators facilitate the communication between transacting parties. The operator is expected to commit the state of user account balances by sending periodic updates to the parent-blockchain. How do commit-chains work? Unlike payment channels, commit-chains are on an always ongoing state once launched and don\u2019t rely on a three-state - opening, live, dispute/closure - model. After an operator launches a commit-chain, users can join and conduct transactions that are recorded on the commit-chain while keeping the freedom to withdraw or exit their assets to the parent-blockchain at any time. Periodic Checkpoint Commitments Commit-chain users may need to periodically observe on-chain checkpoint commitments, which can be instantiated as a Merkle tree root or Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). While ZKPs enforce consistent state transitions on-chain, Merkle root commitments do not, requiring users to participate in challenge-response protocols to challenge operator misbehavior. Data Availability Requirement Users must retrieve and maintain data required to exit a commit-chain since data isn\u2019t broadcasted. Depending on the implementation, if the data is unavailable, you are either forced to exit (like in Plasma) or the operator can be challenged to provide the necessary data (like in NOCUST). On misbehavior, users are allowed to exit with their last confirmed balance. Centralized but Untrusted Intermediary The centralized operator never holds custody of funds so if the operator is not available the worst-case scenario is that users are just unable to make any further off-chain transactions, but they can exit and move to another commit-chain at any time. Transaction Finality Unlike payment channels, the commit-chain operator does not require on-chain collateral to securely route payments between users. Commit-chain transactions do not offer instant transaction finality like payment channels but offer eventual finality after an on-chain checkpoint. However, if an operator chooses to allocate collateral to each user, essentially implementing a payment channel on top of a commit-chain, instant transaction finality becomes possible. Reduced Routing Requirements A single commit-chain can potentially host millions of users, so a few statically connected commit-chains are envisioned to spawn stable networks with low routing complexity. Atomic cross commit-chain transactions have not been proposed yet. Commit-chain security properties The user-side security properties can be generalized as follows: Agreed transition A commit-chain transaction is agreed by at least the sender and the commit-chain operator. Balance security Honest users can always withdraw agreed balances from the commit-chain with an on-chain dispute. Balance security is provided for honest users even if the operator and all other commit-chain users collude since transactions are only considered final when the sender and operator agree to the payment and it\u2019s committed with the periodic on-chain checkpoint. State progression Users can, at any time, enforce an off-chain state transition on-chain. Commitment integrity Since there isn\u2019t a fixed 3-phase lifetime for a commit-chain, users of the commit-chain are able to verify the integrity of the operator\u2019s commitments at any point in time and force the operator to seize operation and rollback to the previous periodic commitment. NOCUST commit-chain Overview The concept of 'NOCUST commit-chains' was first introduced by the team at Liquidity Network and their peers in the form of an academic paper . NOCUST is an account-based commit-chain where an on-chain address is associated to a commit-chain account. The NOCUST on-chain contract expects to periodically receive a constant-sized commitment to the state of the commit-chain ledger from the operator containing each user\u2019s account in the collateral pool. Free establishment Users can deposit any amount of coins within the contract and perform commit-chain payment of any denomination towards other users and with free establishment, users can join the commit-chain without on-chain transaction by requesting an operator signature and immediately receive commit-chain transactions. Agreed transition A transaction within NOCUST is enacted with the signature of the sender and the operator to deter potential double-spend scenarios. Instant transaction finality State progression is only possible if the operator stakes collateral towards the recipient. NOCUST specifies a mechanism to allocate collateral towards all commit-chain users within a constant-size on-chain commitment, which enables instant transaction finality for specified amounts. Allocated collateral is reusable after each on-chain checkpoint and at this point, the transaction throughput is only limited by the operator\u2019s bandwidth and computational throughput - independent of checkpoint commitment interval. Commitment integrity Each user is only required to verify their own balance proof by requesting data from the operator and comparing it with their locally stored state at regular time intervals to observe integrity. In the case of misbehavior, a user can issue a challenge using the NOCUST smart contract. If the operator comes back with invalid information or does not respond, users have an accountable proof of misbehavior. NOCUST supports a provably consistent mode of operation through zkSNARKS. Layer two-state transitions will be validated by the underlying smart contract and the operator is unable to commit invalid state transition without being halted. Comparing commit-chains Comparing NOCUST commit-chain with Plasma Cash, which is the most comprehensive working draft of a Plasma implementation. Comparison data is based on the systemization of knowledge academic paper and sourced from discussions with Georgios Konstantopoulos .

In Plasma Cash, a coin is minted with an on-chain deposit and cannot be merged or split with another coin on the commit-chain, hence it is useful for non-fungible tokens but not practical as a payment system. NOCUST uses ZKPs to enforce consistent state transitions on-chain, Plasma Cash uses Merkle root commitments, which do not and require users to participate in challenge-response protocols to challenge operator misbehavior.

Plasma is a layer-2 scaling solution that was originally proposed by Joseph Poon and Vitalik Buterin in their paper Plasma: Scalable Autonomous Smart Contracts . It is a framework for building scalable applications. Plasma uses a combination of smart contracts and cryptographic verification. Together, these enable fast and cheap transactions by offloading these transactions from the main Ethereum blockchain into a \"side\" chain (sometimes referred as child or plasma chains). These side chains periodically report back to the main chain and use it to settle any disputes (almost like a higher court). Why it is needed According to Vitalik Buterin, it is a \"bad idea\" to build sophisticated features into the base layer of the blockchain, it would create a high level of governance overhead as the platform would have to continually discuss, implement and coordinate newly discovered technical improvements. The time intensive task to add a new feature into the base protocol might cause Ethereum to stagnate. We should not only be relying on changes to the base protocol to continue progressing Ethereum. I do think that as blockchains become more and more mature, layer 1 will necessarily stabilize, and layer 2 will take on more and more of the burden of ongoing innovation and change. How does Plasma work? The Plasma structure is built through the use of smart contracts and Merkle trees, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of child chains - which are, essentially, smaller copies of the parent Ethereum blockchain. Each chain is designed to work in a singular way, serving different needs by coexisting and operating independently. On top of each child chain, more chains can be created and this is what builds a tree-like structure. Deposits and withdrawals of Plasma chain funds with state transitions is enabled by fraud proofs. This ensures enforceable state and exchangeability. It also allows the processing of a greater number of transactions with less data loading on the basic platform. Any user can send funds to another, including those from a different set of participants. These fund transfers can be paid and withdrawn in the native platform coin. Fraud Proofs The communication between the child chains and the root chain is secured by fraud proofs. Each child chain has its own mechanisms for validating blocks and a particular fraud-proof implementation, which can be built on top of different consensus algorithms. The most common are Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority. The fraud proofs ensure that in case of malicious activity, users are able to report dishonest nodes, protect their funds and exit the transaction (which involves an interaction with the main chain). In other words, fraud proofs are used as a mechanism through which a Plasma child chain files a complaint to its parent chain or to the root chain. These proofs use an interactive funds-withdrawal protocol. In order to withdraw a certain amount of funds, an exit time is needed. The exiting party must confirm the outputs via UTXO model requesting a withdrawal. Network participants can then submit a bonded proof that has to be confirmed and tested if any funds have been spent. If the event appears to be wrong, it is treated as fraudulent, and the confirmation is cancelled. With time, another bonded round allows the withdrawal to happen, bonding to state before a committed timestamp. An incorrect Plasma chain can be quickly exited by participants. In case of attack, participants can quickly exit and save their costs, ensuring security within the system. Example If Alice keeps 1 ETH in a Plasma chain, for instance, it gets recorded into a block, whereas the consensus is met due to fraud proofs. Further commitments are enforced and submitted on the base chain, and her funds are held in its smart contract: Plasma: Pros and Cons Undoubtedly, plasma is a good solution for scalability issues but Plasma does have some drawbacks. Each new plasma iteration reveals a new research problem that needs to be addressed, leading to multiple Plasma variants that navigate deployment trade-offs in different ways. We will compare these different variants in detail below but let's first compare the pros and cons of plasma and it's variants. Pros Cons Plasma will help the Ethereum blockchain scale by taking operations off-chain Plasma requires a centralized component in order to operate as the off-chain component is managed by authorities Lower fees and faster operations also enables computationally intensive applications to run on a blockchain Long waiting periods(7-14 days) for users who wish to withdraw their funds Eliminating significant amount of unnecessary data in the main chain which also reduces the processing bandwidth of nodes Poor experience for users who don\u2019t have a large number of assets and don\u2019t want to wait weeks to access them It is compatible with various on-chain scaling solutions such as sharding, varying block sizes, etc. New security risks/challenges (primarly for exits) that would need to be addressed to maintain immutability. Many plasma variants have their own set of drawbacks such as: * Plasma MVP has time constraints, is a less than ideal user experience, and is vulnerable to network congestion. * Plasma Cash relies on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to function which requires heavy transaction histories. You will have to keep track of the value and have to be constantly collecting proofs of non-inclusion, and so when you transfer ownership of the NFT you have to transfer its history as well. Exploring popular plasma flavours There isn\u2019t any single project called \"Plasma\". Instead, there are lots of different projects that use the tools provided by the Plasma framework/specification. Currently there are four main distinct versions of the protocol: Plasma Cash Plasma Cash is a Plasma design primarily built for storing and transferring non-fungible tokens. It is highly scalable because users only ever need to keep track of their own tokens. It uses Sparse Merkle Trees (SMT) for non inclusion proofs and hence can only be used for NFTs since SMTs uses indexing. Each block has a \u2018slot\u2019 for each coin (unique deposit). When a coin is spent, a transaction proof is recorded in that coin\u2019s respective slot in the block. Note: Coin defragmentation research to support FTs is going on currently Plasma Debit Plasma Debit is like Plasma Cash, except every token is a payment channel between the user and the chain operator. It\u2019s sort of like a big Lightning Network hub, but the channels can be transferred just like a Plasma Cash token. Transactions are super fast and you only need to keep track of your own channels. Plasma Prime Plasma Prime is a fancy new design that makes use of RSA accumulators to solve the problem of large history proofs in Plasma Cash. MVP (Minimum Viable Plasma) Plasma MVP is a design for an extremely simple UTXO-based Plasma chain. The basic Plasma MVP specification enables high-throughput payment transactions, but does not support more complicated constructions like scripts or smart contracts. Plasma MVP relies on confirmation signatures because withdrawals are processed in order based on the position of the output being withdrawn. Users need to sign a signature before making a transaction, wait to see the transaction included in a valid block, and then sign another signature. These second signatures must also be included within a plasma block, reducing block space available for more transactions! Note: Confirmation signatures make for pretty bad user experience. More Viable Plasma , also known as MoreVP , is an extension to Minimal Viable Plasma that removes the need for confirmation signatures. MoreVP modifies the process through which users can withdraw their funds. The ordering of each withdrawal becomes based on the position of the youngest input to the transaction that created an output.

When a coin is spent, a transaction proof is recorded in that coin\u2019s respective slot in the block. Note: Coin defragmentation research to support FTs is going on currently Plasma Debit Plasma Debit is like Plasma Cash, except every token is a payment channel between the user and the chain operator. It\u2019s sort of like a big Lightning Network hub, but the channels can be transferred just like a Plasma Cash token. Transactions are super fast and you only need to keep track of your own channels. Plasma Prime Plasma Prime is a fancy new design that makes use of RSA accumulators to solve the problem of large history proofs in Plasma Cash. MVP (Minimum Viable Plasma) Plasma MVP is a design for an extremely simple UTXO-based Plasma chain. The basic Plasma MVP specification enables high-throughput payment transactions, but does not support more complicated constructions like scripts or smart contracts. Plasma MVP relies on confirmation signatures because withdrawals are processed in order based on the position of the output being withdrawn. Users need to sign a signature before making a transaction, wait to see the transaction included in a valid block, and then sign another signature. These second signatures must also be included within a plasma block, reducing block space available for more transactions! Note: Confirmation signatures make for pretty bad user experience. More Viable Plasma , also known as MoreVP , is an extension to Minimal Viable Plasma that removes the need for confirmation signatures. MoreVP modifies the process through which users can withdraw their funds. The ordering of each withdrawal becomes based on the position of the youngest input to the transaction that created an output.","title":"Exploring popular plasma flavours"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/#comparing-different-models-of-plasma","text":"Plasma Design Component Plasma MVP Plasma Cash Plasma Debit Data Structure Binary Merkle tree Sparse Merkle Tree Sparse Merkle tree Consensus Any (PoW,PoA,PoS) Any (PoW,PoA,PoS) Single or few operators preferred over because of payment channel structure Deposits UTXOs representation, support for ETH, ERC20 Unique Coin ID for each deposit, NFTs only Accounts with unique coin IDs for each deposit, NFTs and FTs only Fees Plasma transaction fees to validators and gas fees when exiting/withdrawing to rootchain or other chains Same as MVP Users pay via operator-led payment channel instead of directly to other users Signatures Tx signature before block inclusion, confirmation signature post-inclusion Confirmation signatures to avoid griefing No confirmation signatures Exits/Withdrawals Proof of unspent UTXO required to exit, priority based on how old UTXO is Proof of coin\u2019s latest two transactions, proof of block inclusion, no priority Proof of coin\u2019s latest two transactions, proof that fraction of coin hasn\u2019t been previously spent, proof of block inclusion, no exit priority Let's compare pros, cons and use cases for each model now Type Plasma MVP Plasma Cash Plasma Debit Pros Scalable, all signatures sent to operator in PoA, High fungibility Very scalable, watchers or users themselves need to only keep track of their own coins not all coins on the chain Very scalable, watchers or users themselves need to only keep track of their own coins, Enables transactions with NFTs and FTs, Efficient balance updates don\u2019t need to be included in blocks as agreement can be made between operator and coinholder (similar to channels) Cons Watchers or users themselves are required to watch and challenge invalid exits, Potential for honest bond slashing if operator withholds blocks and user attempts to re-submit transaction Coin proofs can be massive, Coins are in fixed denomination, Watchers or users themselves are required to watch and challenge invalid txs with their own coins Heavy reliance on operator, can be hedged by creating a set of rotating operators, Coin proofs can be massive, Requires operator to lock up significant funds in advance to fund payment channels, Tx size constrained by initial coin deposit size, Enabling decentralized exchange on Debit is non-trivial Use Cases Low-trust use cases (PoA), Exchanges, securities, P2P payments, recurring/bill payments, gaming Collectibles, Asset management (real estate, art) Use cases with high-trust of operators, ewallet or service providers, Gaming, Asset Management, P2P payments","title":"Comparing different models of plasma"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/#resources","text":"Plasma Group What is Ethereum Plasma The State of Plasma How Plasma Work Learn Plasma Comparing plasma models","title":"Resources"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/state-channels/","text":"State Channels What Are State Channels? State channels are a very broad and simple way to think about blockchain interactions which could occur on the blockchain, but instead get conducted off of the blockchain, without significantly increasing the risk of any participant. The most well known example of this strategy is the idea of payment channels in Bitcoin, which allow for instant fee-less payments to be sent directly between two parties. State channels are very similar to the concept of payment channels in Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, but instead of only supporting payments, they also support general \u2018state updates.\u2019 For example, moves conducted in a game of Chess could be updated in a state channel and only broadcasted to the Ethereum network once the game is finished. This allows ethereum applications to \"move\" transactions off-chain, increasing the usefulness of the network as a whole. Who is working on State Channels? Teams currently working on State Channels are: * CelerX * Connext Network * Counterfactual How do State Channels work? State channels work by \u201clocking up\u201d some portion of blockchain state into a multisig contract, controlled by a defined set of participants. The state that is \u201clocked up\u201d is called a state deposit. For instance, this might be an amount of ether or an ERC20 token, but could also be a cryptokitty or an ENS domain name. After the state deposit is locked, channel participants use off-chain messaging to exchange and sign valid ethereum transactions without deploying them to chain. These are transactions that could be put on chain anytime, but are not. A basic breakdown: Part of the blockchain state is locked via multisignature or some sort of smart contract, so that a specific set of participants must completely agree with each other to update it. Participants update the state amongst themselves by constructing and signing transactions that could be submitted to the blockchain, but instead are merely held onto for now. Each new update \u201ctrumps\u201d previous updates. Finally, participants submit the state back to the blockchain, which closes the state channel and unlocks the state again (usually in a different configuration than it started with). Since all exchanged transactions are equally valid as far as the blockchain is concerned, state channels need a mechanism to ensure that the latest off-chain state (i.e., the latest move in our chess game) is the one that ultimately gets settled on the main chain. Thus, if a party attempts to unilaterally close a channel, other parties in the channel have a period of time \u2014 a \"dispute window\" \u2014 in which they have an opportunity to submit a more recent state, thereby proving that fraud was attempted. Once an infraction is proven, the contract handles the resolution process, which typically involves punishing the guilty party by slashing their deposited funds (though one could also simply update to the valid state and proceed accordingly). If the \u201cstate\u201d being updated between participants was a digital currency balance, then we would have a payment channel. Steps 1 and 3, which open and close the channel, involve blockchain operations. But in step 2 an unlimited number of updates can be rapidly made without the need to involve the blockchain at all \u2014 and this is where the power of state channels comes into play, because only steps 1 and 3 need to be published to the network, pay fees, or wait for confirmations. In fact, with careful planning and design, state channels can remain open almost indefinitely, and be used as part of larger hub and spoke systems to power an entire economy or ecosystem. Difference between State Channels and Sidechains State Channel pros State channels have strong privacy properties: This is because everything is happening \u201cinside\u201d a channel between participants, rather than broadcast publicly and recorded on-chain. Only the opening and closing transactions must be public. Whereas in sidechains every transaction is published on the sidechain which is received by every participant on the sidechain irrespective of the fact that you are not interacting with all of the participants on the sidechain. State channels have instant finality, meaning that as soon as both parties sign a state update, it can be considered final. Both parties have a very high guarantee that, if necessary, they can \u201cenforce\u201d that state on-chain. State Channel cons State Channels need 100% availability of all the participants involved: As we have discussed above that if anyone the participants goes unavailable, then this could prove costly to him. The participants can use a third party service to represent him if he goes unavailable (see, for instance, http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/05/22/pisa/ ), but the possibility of the representative getting attacked or bribed makes it a problem for state channels. Whereas in sidechains you don\u2019t have to be available all the time you are on the sidechain. State channels are best used for applications with a defined set of participants: This is because the state deposit contract(the contract used to lock the state) must always know the participants/entities (i.e. addresses) that are part of a given channel. We can add and remove people, but it requires a change to the contract each time. Whereas in sidechains there is no such limitation on the movement of the participants. State Channels are particularly useful where participants are going to be exchanging many state updates over a long period of time: This is because there is an initial cost to creating a channel in deploying the state deposit contract. But once it is deployed, the cost per state update inside that channel is extremely low. Sidechain pros Sidechains are permanent. You don\u2019t have create your own sidechain for specific purpose if there is one present: Sidechains are created and maintained once made. We don\u2019t close sidechains, rather we lock the assets on sidechain to move back to the mainchain. This can be helpful in the way that anyone who is doing a specific task off blockchain/mainchain (for eg. transacting in dogecoin) will come to the same sidechain. So, you don\u2019t have to create separate chains for every new participant. Whereas in state channels, an on-chain operation is required to add a participant to an existing channel. But projects such as Raiden network, and more generally the technique of meta-channels, offer a partial solution to this. They create a mesh of participants so you don\u2019t have to create a new channel for every new participant you interact with. You can interact with participants indirectly creating a channel between you and recipient through some other participant who is common to both: you and the recipient. Sidechains allow cryptocurrencies to interact with one another: They add flexibility and allow developers to experiment with Beta releases of Altcoins or software updates before pushing them on to the main chain. Traditional banking functions like issuing and tracking ownership of shares can be tested on sidechains before moving them onto main chains. Sidechain cons Sidechains do not benefit from the security of the main-chain. A user interacting on a side-chain must trust the security properties of that sidechain, because if it compromised or malevolent, a user has no guarantee of withdrawal to the main-chain. In contrast, participants in a state channel can always return to the main-chain so long as they follow the protocol. Sidechains need a lot of initial investment to start off: To create a sidechain we need to have enough miners so that the network is safe from attackers. Also, we have to make sure that they are up and running. Whereas there is no blockchain involved in state channels. So, no such requirement is needed. A Federation is needed for sidechains: This adds another layer between the mainchain and the sidechain. This could prove as another weak point for the attackers to attack by bribing or attacking the federation. Whereas in state channel we just need a smart contract to do this for us.

Summary ZK-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are a type of cryptographic proof technology that enables users to share validated data or perform computations with a third party without the data or computation being revealed to the third-party, also known as a zero-knowledge proof, in a way that is publicly verifiable. In simpler terms, a zero-knowledge proof can prove something is true without having to reveal what exactly it is proving. For example, ZK-STARKs would allow Alice to verify Bob's banking information using a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof instead of revealing the confidential information to Alice. Prior to the creation of ZK-STARKs, ZK-SNARKs were used to create ZK proof systems, but required a trusted party or parties to initially setup the ZK proof system which introduced the vulnerability of those trusted parties compromising the privacy of the entire system. ZK-STARKs improve upon this technology by removing the need for a trusted setup. Scaling benefits of using STARKs STARKs improve two of the problems of permissionless blockchains: scalability and privacy. The pioneer in STARK technology StarkWare Industries' current ZK-STARK research is focusing on scalability first and then privacy later on. STARKs improve scalability by allowing developers to move computations and storage off-chain. Off-chain services will be able to generate STARK proofs that attest the integrity of off-chain computations. These proofs are then placed back on chain for any interested party to validate the computation. Moving the bulk of computational work off-chain using STARKs allows existing blockchain infrastructure to scale exponentially while trustlessly maintaining computational integrity. Differences between ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs ZK-SNARKs require a trusted setup phase whereas ZK-STARKs use publicly verifiable randomness to create trustlessly verifiable computation systems.

In simpler terms, a zero-knowledge proof can prove something is true without having to reveal what exactly it is proving. For example, ZK-STARKs would allow Alice to verify Bob's banking information using a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof instead of revealing the confidential information to Alice. Prior to the creation of ZK-STARKs, ZK-SNARKs were used to create ZK proof systems, but required a trusted party or parties to initially setup the ZK proof system which introduced the vulnerability of those trusted parties compromising the privacy of the entire system. ZK-STARKs improve upon this technology by removing the need for a trusted setup.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/#scaling-benefits-of-using-starks","text":"STARKs improve two of the problems of permissionless blockchains: scalability and privacy.

Off-chain services will be able to generate STARK proofs that attest the integrity of off-chain computations. These proofs are then placed back on chain for any interested party to validate the computation.

An example of this could be arcade tokens, these pieces of metal are the physical representation of the amount of games that a person is able to play. However, unlike arcade tokens, tokens built on top of Ethereum are entirely virtual, but can still have representational value assigned to them in the same way. ERC20 tokens are by far the most used token on Ethereum and this guide will break down the ERC20 standard as well as what it means for something to be an ERC20 token. The Importance of Standards When a large group of people are trying to come together to build something, it is important that there be a community standard so that all builders are able to format their work. For example, every country has a standard for which side of the road cars are supposed to drive on. As a result, car manufacturers must build cars that have steering wheels that are compatible with local standards. In the same way with Ethereum tokens, a standard was needed to simplify the experience of creating and working with tokens. If no one followed a standard and each team had their own way of building tokens with different functionality then every wallet, exchange, and smart contract would need to write code specifically for every token. The ERC20 standard is a specification that makes it easy to add ERC20 compliant tokens to a service or smart contract. Fungibility and Divisibility of ERC20s ERC20 tokens are fungible in nature, meaning that there isn\u2019t a distinction between individual tokens. For example, if I have 100 metal marbles in my hand that are all the same size and color, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. In the same way, if I have 100 of the same ERC20 token, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. This contrasts with ERC721 tokens which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as CryptoKitties. In addition, ERC20s can be thought of as the most simple unit of account and can be used for a wide range of things including currency, rewards points, debt slips, interest accruing bonds, and much more. They are also highly divisible and can be sent in extremely small increments. The ERC20 Standard The standard is made up of six required functions, two required events, and three optional properties. To begin with, it is important to note that the token contract is in charge of maintaining a list of addresses and associated balances as well as allowances. Allowances are used to allow different addresses to spend the tokens from your balance on your behalf. Let\u2019s use the token contract below as an example of a standard ERC20 token contract that implements all the requirements as well as the optional properties. We can currently see that there is a total supply of 100 tokens and are all owned by a single address. In addition, there haven\u2019t been any allowances set. Optional Properties Even though they are optional, most ERC20 tokens implement these properties to give their token more descriptive attributes. * name * symbol * decimals - The number of decimals determines how divisible the token is. The most common is 18 decimals which means that for every one token the smallest divisible amount is 1x10^-18. Required Functions totalSupply - The totalSupply function returns the current supply of tokens for the contract. In this case the total supply is 100 tokens. balanceOf - If someone calls the balanceOf function with a specific address, it will return the token balance for that address. In this example, balanceOf is being called with 0x58c... and returns 100 tokens. transfer - The transfer function requires a recipient address as well as an amount to send. The function will only work if the amount specified is less than or equal to the sender's balance. We can see in the example below that the transfer simply decreases the sender\u2019s balance by 10 and increases the recipient's balance by 10. Once complete, the function returns a true value to show that the transfer was successful. approve - If an address has a balance, then it can use the approve function to allow a specific amount of it\u2019s balance to be spent by another address. Below, address 0x123... is allowing 0x58c... to spend 10 of its tokens. Similar to transfer, the function returns a true value to show that the approval was successful. Note that this function doesn\u2019t affect the balances directly, only the allowances. allowance - The allowance function is used to see how much an address is allowed to spend from another address. We can confirm that since the approve function has already been called and updated the allowance, that the current allowance for 0x58c... to spend from 0x123... is 10 tokens. transferFrom - The transferFrom function is used when an address with an allowance wants to transfer the balance from one address to another. So 0x58c... can now move its allotted 10 tokens to 0xa3b... by specifying the address that they want to transfer from, the recipient address, and the amount. Since 0x58c\u2026 has a valid allowance of 10 tokens from 0x123... the transaction is valid and the 10 tokens are sent to 0xa3b.... Required Events Events in Ethereum are usually triggered when a transaction changes a contract\u2019s state. They are important because they are able to provide information to things that are external to the Ethereum blockchain, which can then trigger other external things to happen. In ERC20 token contracts, an event is fired when either the Balances or Allowances are updated. Transfer - The Transfer event is fired when someone either successfully uses the transfer or transferFrom functions. It will give you the address of both the recipient and the sender as well as the amount of tokens that was sent in the transaction. Approval - The Approval event is fired when the approve function is successfully called and will return the owner, spender, and the approved amount. Additional Features for ERC20 Tokens In addition to the required functions, there are other features that ERC20 token contracts can add. The two primary ones are mintable and burnable tokens. Mintable tokens have a minting function that allows for the creation of additional tokens, meaning that the total supply is not fixed. The minting functions are usually only allowed to be called by a specific set of privileged addresses. While burnable tokens are the opposite in that they can be burned and the supply can be reduced when called by authorized addresses. It is also possible to have a contract that includes both minting and burning functionality.

Note that this function doesn\u2019t affect the balances directly, only the allowances. allowance - The allowance function is used to see how much an address is allowed to spend from another address. We can confirm that since the approve function has already been called and updated the allowance, that the current allowance for 0x58c... to spend from 0x123... is 10 tokens. transferFrom - The transferFrom function is used when an address with an allowance wants to transfer the balance from one address to another. So 0x58c... can now move its allotted 10 tokens to 0xa3b... by specifying the address that they want to transfer from, the recipient address, and the amount. Since 0x58c\u2026 has a valid allowance of 10 tokens from 0x123... the transaction is valid and the 10 tokens are sent to 0xa3b....","title":"Required Functions"},{"location":"guides/a-straightforward-guide-erc20-tokens/#required-events","text":"Events in Ethereum are usually triggered when a transaction changes a contract\u2019s state.

Etherscan is a block explorer, which allows users to view information about transactions that have been submitted to the blockchain, verify contract code, and visualize network data. This guide will focus on explaining the information that is displayed for different types of transactions on Etherscan. Components of an Ethereum Transaction on Etherscan Transaction Hash: A unique identifier that can be used to locate a specific transaction. Status: The current state of a transaction (Success, Failed, or Pending). Block: The block number that the transaction was included in. Timestamp: The time that the block was mined in UTC. From: The account that originally sent the transaction. To: The account that the transaction is addressed to. Value: The amount of Ether included in the transaction. Transaction Fee: The amount of Ether paid to the miner for processing the transaction, which is calculated by multiplying the amount of gas used by the gas price. Gas Limit: The upper limit of how much computational work and storage the sender is willing to expend on the transaction. Gas Used by Transaction: The amount of computational work and storage used in the transaction. Gas Price: The amount of Ether per unit of gas the user is willing to pay for the transaction, commonly denoted in a subunit of Ether known as Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1x10^-9 Ether. Nonce: The count of transactions sent out of the account. The number is initialized at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each transaction sent. Input Data: Information that is passed to a smart contract when a transaction is sent to its address. However, if the transaction is creating a contract, the contract\u2019s bytecode is placed in the input data field. I recommend checking out this article if you are not very familiar with how gas is used in Ethereum. Gas and Ethereum Transactions Reading data from the blockchain has no cost, however, when you want to change data recorded in the chain you are required to submit a transaction. In short, gas is a way of measuring the amount of computation and storage required to execute a change. Transactions in Bitcoin are rather straightforward, you have an amount of BTC and you create a transaction that sends it to another address. With the complexity of smart contracts, Ethereum transactions can have a large range of effects. In order to make sure that a user appropriately pays for the complexity of their transaction, gas is used to measure how much computational work and storage is needed in order to execute it. When submitting a transaction, a user will specify a gas limit, which is the highest amount of gas the transaction is allowed to expend. The transaction will fail if it exceeds the limit. The gas price is the amount of Ether the user is willing to pay per unit of gas (most commonly expressed in Gwei. 1 Gwei = 1x10^-9 Ether). For transactions where not all of the gas is used, the remaining Ether is refunded back to the account that created the transaction. \u201cOut of Gas\u201d Error Message There are a number of reasons why an Ethereum transaction might fail. The most common issue is that the transaction ran out of gas when the miner attempted to execute it. This will be apparent when you see a message that says \u201cWarning! Error encountered during contract execution [Out of gas]\u201d on Etherscan. This means that the transaction surpassed the gas limit that was specified when the transaction was created. Please use caution when setting the gas limit for a transaction that will be sent to a contract. If the limit is set too high the transaction might burn up all the Ether in your account. When a transaction runs out of gas, the proposed transaction fails, but the Ether that was dedicated to paying for gas is still given to the miner. Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) vs Contract Accounts There are two different types of accounts in Ethereum. The first are externally owned accounts (EOA), which are derived from a private key and able to generate transactions to poke the Ethereum network to do something. The second kind are contract accounts, which are able to store and execute code only when prompted by a transaction from an EOA. There are three different types of transactions between these accounts: an EOA sending Ether to another EOA, an EOA creating a contract, or an EOA sending a transaction to a contract. Transferring Ether Between Two Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) In the random transaction below, we can see that one externally owned account (EOA) is sending Ether to another EOA. We know this because the data input is empty, the To address isn\u2019t labeled as a contract address, and the value field is filled out. When moving Ether, we are telling the Ethereum network please decrease my balance x amount and increase the other account\u2019s balance by that amount. If the transaction is valid, then the global state of Ethereum updates the balances. In terms of gas considerations, a standard transfer of Ether from one EOA to another EOA costs 21,000 gas, which we can see is the amount used. Transferring ERC20 Tokens One of the biggest differences between transferring ERC20 tokens versus transferring Ether is that the transaction is addressed to the Token\u2019s contract address rather than the account we want to send the tokens to. In the random transaction below, the input data field includes the function we would like to call (in this case transfer). In addition, the inputs for the function, which includes the recipient's address along with the amount of tokens we want to send formatted in hexadecimal . Etherscan marks the To account as the DAI contract address and added a field called Tokens Transferred to display the input data in a more human readable format. Typically, the value field is left empty for token transfers because we only need to update to the contract\u2019s balances. Lastly, the gas cost for transferring ERC20 tokens can vary depending on how to contract was implemented. An Externally Owned Account (EOA) Creating a Contract Below is the transaction that created the Ethhub contract wallet. The most notable difference for contract creation transactions is that the input data contains the bytecode for the contract\u2019s logic. We can see that the contract\u2019s address is displayed in the To field with \u201cCreated\u201d next to it. Transferring Ether from an Externally Owned Account (EOA) to a Contract Account If you are sending Ether to a contract address, the gas cost can vary from the standard 21,000 gas. Viewing the transaction above we can see that someone made an Ether deposit to the Ethhub contract wallet, which required 22,511 gas. This is because the contract wallet also emits a Deposit event when receiving Ether, which bumps the gas cost over 21,000. That is why it is important to know what kind of account you are sending to before you assume that the gas cost will be 21,000 gas or else the transaction might run out of gas. In addition, there can be harmful side effects to sending a transaction to a contract that you aren\u2019t familiar with because contracts are able to forward messages to other contracts. Meaning that calling a function or simply depositing Ether to a malicious contract could execute code that might yield a negative result. Please always make sure that you trust the contract that you are about to submit a transaction to and set a reasonable gas limit. Resources Etherscan What is Ethereum Gas?

Historically, the interest rates earned on stablecoin lending in Ethereum have had a large spread to what can be earned in the traditional finance sector, presenting a nice opportunity to earn extra yield on cash. This guide will show you how to earn high-yield interest on USD using the Ethereum blockchain. If you are brand new to Ethereum, we suggest first reading our new user guide . 1. Acquire Stablecoins The key to this guide is understanding the concept of stablecoins . These are 1:1 representations of USD on the Ethereum network, essentially digitalizing your dollar. In order to earn yield using decentralized finance, you will need to acquire a stablecoin. We suggest either Dai or USDC, both of which can be acquired on Coinbase . Coinbase offers a feeless onramp for USDC, however Dai is the more trustless option and usually offers a higher yield. If you'd like to go with Dai, the feeless route is to go fiat > USDC via Coinbase and then trade USDC > Dai on dYdX . 2. Pick a Lending Protocol Now that you have stablecoins, you need to find borrowers that are willing to pay you yield in order to borrow your coins. There are many of these protocols built on Ethereum and you can easily find what rates are being offered on the stablecoin of your choice. Please note that some protocols have a longer history and better security standards than others, which should factor into your decision as well. For this guide, we will use Maker's Dai Savings Rate . If you picked USDC, we suggest using Compound . 3. Start Earning Interest At this point you're ready to start earning interest on your stablecoin. The website to interact with the Maker protocol is called Oasis. Navigate to the save section and you will be presented with the current APR%. Follow the guide to deposit your Dai and your savings account will then be open: Below is an image from Maker on how the mechanism functions: Now you can watch your interest earned count up in real time and withdraw at any point. 4. Insurance There is always the possibility that smart contracts have bugs. If you are worried about this, it's possible to insurance your savings account using Nexus Mutual . This gives you coverage on the smart contract you picked to lend on for a small fee. 5. Rate Movements Most lending rates on Ethereum are variable, meaning they can move up and down at any time, much like traditional savings accounts. Different protocols handle rate movements in different ways but all are derived on the function of supply and demand. If there is more demand than supply, rates will go up, and vice versa.

Rate Movements"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/","text":"A Graphical Guide for Understanding Uniswap Summary Uniswap is an exchange protocol that allows users to trustlessly swap ERC20 tokens. Rather using the traditional order book model, Uniswap pools tokens into smart contracts and users trade against these liquidity pools. Anyone can swap tokens, add tokens to a pool to earn fees, or list a token on Uniswap. This guide is meant to help beginners understand how Uniswap works under the hood. While the interface may appear simple, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. I recommend this resource if you are interested in understanding how to use the Uniswap specifically. ERC20 Token Primer ERC20 tokens are the most common type of token built on top of Ethereum. They are fungible in nature, meaning that there isn\u2019t a distinction between individual tokens. For example, if I have 100 metal marbles in my hand that are all the same size and color, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. In the same way, if I have 100 of the same ERC20 token, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. This contrasts with ERC721 tokens which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as cryptokitties. ERC20s can be thought of as the most simple unit of account for a wide range of use cases including currency, rewards points, debt slips, interest accruing bonds, and much more. They are also highly divisible and can be sent in small increments. Since this type of token is so pervasive, it is important to develop a simple way of swapping between them. Please view the link here for more information on ERC20s. Overview of Uniswap\u2019s Contracts When viewing Uniswap\u2019s website, it is important to keep in mind that it is much more than just the interface. Uniswap starndaizes how ERC20s are exchanged with a set of smart contracts. Anyone can build an interface that connects to these contracts and instantly be able to start exchanging with everyone else that is using Uniswap. There are two different types of contracts that make up Uniswap. The first is known as an Exchange contract. Exchange contracts hold a pool of a specific token and Ether that users can swap against. The second kind of contract is the Factory contract which is in charge of creating new Exchange contracts and registering the ERC20 token address to its Exchange contract address. There are no listing fees to add a token on Uniswap, instead anyone can call a function on the Factory contract to register a new token. The graphic below is an example of when DAI was added to Uniswap. Someone first called the createExchange function in the Factory contract with DAI\u2019s contract address. Then the Factory contract checks it\u2019s registry to see if an Exchange contract has been created for that token address. If no Exchange address is listed, the factory contract deploys an Exchange contract and records the Exchange address in its registry. Liquidity Pools Uniswap is unique in that it doesn\u2019t use an order book to derive the price of an asset. In a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase Pro, the price of an asset listed on the exchange is determined by where the highest price someone is willing to pay and the lowest price someone is willing to sell meet. We can see in the image below, that the highest bid price for BTC on Coinbase Pro at that point was $9301.36 and the lowest asking price was $9301.37. Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contract\u2019s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn\u2019t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve. You can learn more about the formula here . But if users are only just sending cryptocurrency, how does the ratio of Ether to token remain priced correctly relative to external markets? The answer is the pools maintain a ratio relative to the price of the rest of the market through people arbitraging the pool. Imagine that the DAI:ETH pool is expressed in terms of a scale and when the scale is balanced the pool is appropriately priced relative to the market price of a centralized exchange. Let\u2019s say that the current price for ETH in USD on a centralized exchange is $150 and the ratio in the Uniswap DAI:ETH pool returns 150 DAI for 1 ETH. As a result, our scale is balanced because the pool matches the current market price on the centralized exchange. Now let\u2019s assume that there is a movement in the market that pushes the price of ETH to $100 on the centralized exchange. Due to the price movement, we can now see that our scale is off balance relative to the market price because people can now swap 1 ETH for 150 DAI on Uniswap when the market price on a centralized exchange is $100 for 1 ETH. In response, someone can now put ETH into the pool, draw out DAI, then sell the DAI back for ETH on the centralized exchange for profit, and then repeat. They can do this until the pool has balanced out and reflects the current market price on a different exchange. As a result, third party arbitrages play a large role in maintaining the correct ratio of token to Ether in Uniswap pools. Swapping ERC20 \u21c4 ERC20 When interacting with a single Exchange contract, a user is able to swap between Ether and a specific ERC20 token. However, Uniswap does allow users to directly swap an ERC20 to another ERC20 in a single transaction. In the example below, the user has DAI and would like to receive MKR. As a result, the user calls the tokenToTokenSwap function which adds DAI to the DAI pool and kicks ETH to the MKR pool and returns MKR to the address that initially sent the transaction. Liquidity Providers When an Exchange contract is first created for a token, both the token and Ether pools are empty. The first person that deposits into the contract is the one that determines the ratio between the token and Ether. If they deposit a ratio that is different from what the current market rate is, then an arbitrage opportunity is available. When liquidity providers are adding to an established pool, they should add a proportional amount of token and Ether to the pool. If they don\u2019t, the liquidity they added is at risk of being arbitraged as well. In addition, larger liquidity pools are beneficial to users because they allow for larger swaps to happen without skewing the token to ETH ratio too far along the curve. Uniswap incentives users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly a 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps. Lastly, special ERC20 tokens known as liquidity tokens are minted to the provider\u2019s address in proportion to how much liquidity they contributed to the pool. The tokens are burned when the user wants to receive the liquidity they contributed plus the fees that we accumulated while their liquidity was locked. I recommend reading this article if you are curious about the advantages and risks of being a liquidity provider.

I recommend this resource if you are interested in understanding how to use the Uniswap specifically.","title":"Summary"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#erc20-token-primer","text":"ERC20 tokens are the most common type of token built on top of Ethereum. They are fungible in nature, meaning that there isn\u2019t a distinction between individual tokens. For example, if I have 100 metal marbles in my hand that are all the same size and color, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. In the same way, if I have 100 of the same ERC20 token, it doesn\u2019t matter which one I give you. This contrasts with ERC721 tokens which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as cryptokitties. ERC20s can be thought of as the most simple unit of account for a wide range of use cases including currency, rewards points, debt slips, interest accruing bonds, and much more. They are also highly divisible and can be sent in small increments. Since this type of token is so pervasive, it is important to develop a simple way of swapping between them. Please view the link here for more information on ERC20s.","title":"ERC20 Token Primer"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#overview-of-uniswaps-contracts","text":"When viewing Uniswap\u2019s website, it is important to keep in mind that it is much more than just the interface. Uniswap starndaizes how ERC20s are exchanged with a set of smart contracts. Anyone can build an interface that connects to these contracts and instantly be able to start exchanging with everyone else that is using Uniswap. There are two different types of contracts that make up Uniswap. The first is known as an Exchange contract. Exchange contracts hold a pool of a specific token and Ether that users can swap against. The second kind of contract is the Factory contract which is in charge of creating new Exchange contracts and registering the ERC20 token address to its Exchange contract address. There are no listing fees to add a token on Uniswap, instead anyone can call a function on the Factory contract to register a new token. The graphic below is an example of when DAI was added to Uniswap. Someone first called the createExchange function in the Factory contract with DAI\u2019s contract address. Then the Factory contract checks it\u2019s registry to see if an Exchange contract has been created for that token address. If no Exchange address is listed, the factory contract deploys an Exchange contract and records the Exchange address in its registry.","title":"Overview of Uniswap\u2019s Contracts"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#liquidity-pools","text":"Uniswap is unique in that it doesn\u2019t use an order book to derive the price of an asset. In a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase Pro, the price of an asset listed on the exchange is determined by where the highest price someone is willing to pay and the lowest price someone is willing to sell meet. We can see in the image below, that the highest bid price for BTC on Coinbase Pro at that point was $9301.36 and the lowest asking price was $9301.37. Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contract\u2019s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn\u2019t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve. You can learn more about the formula here . But if users are only just sending cryptocurrency, how does the ratio of Ether to token remain priced correctly relative to external markets? The answer is the pools maintain a ratio relative to the price of the rest of the market through people arbitraging the pool. Imagine that the DAI:ETH pool is expressed in terms of a scale and when the scale is balanced the pool is appropriately priced relative to the market price of a centralized exchange. Let\u2019s say that the current price for ETH in USD on a centralized exchange is $150 and the ratio in the Uniswap DAI:ETH pool returns 150 DAI for 1 ETH. As a result, our scale is balanced because the pool matches the current market price on the centralized exchange. Now let\u2019s assume that there is a movement in the market that pushes the price of ETH to $100 on the centralized exchange. Due to the price movement, we can now see that our scale is off balance relative to the market price because people can now swap 1 ETH for 150 DAI on Uniswap when the market price on a centralized exchange is $100 for 1 ETH. In response, someone can now put ETH into the pool, draw out DAI, then sell the DAI back for ETH on the centralized exchange for profit, and then repeat. They can do this until the pool has balanced out and reflects the current market price on a different exchange. As a result, third party arbitrages play a large role in maintaining the correct ratio of token to Ether in Uniswap pools.","title":"Liquidity Pools"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#swapping-erc20-erc20","text":"When interacting with a single Exchange contract, a user is able to swap between Ether and a specific ERC20 token. However, Uniswap does allow users to directly swap an ERC20 to another ERC20 in a single transaction. In the example below, the user has DAI and would like to receive MKR. As a result, the user calls the tokenToTokenSwap function which adds DAI to the DAI pool and kicks ETH to the MKR pool and returns MKR to the address that initially sent the transaction.","title":"Swapping ERC20 \u21c4 ERC20"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#liquidity-providers","text":"When an Exchange contract is first created for a token, both the token and Ether pools are empty. The first person that deposits into the contract is the one that determines the ratio between the token and Ether. If they deposit a ratio that is different from what the current market rate is, then an arbitrage opportunity is available. When liquidity providers are adding to an established pool, they should add a proportional amount of token and Ether to the pool. If they don\u2019t, the liquidity they added is at risk of being arbitraged as well. In addition, larger liquidity pools are beneficial to users because they allow for larger swaps to happen without skewing the token to ETH ratio too far along the curve. Uniswap incentives users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly a 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps. Lastly, special ERC20 tokens known as liquidity tokens are minted to the provider\u2019s address in proportion to how much liquidity they contributed to the pool. The tokens are burned when the user wants to receive the liquidity they contributed plus the fees that we accumulated while their liquidity was locked. I recommend reading this article if you are curious about the advantages and risks of being a liquidity provider.","title":"Liquidity Providers"},{"location":"guides/graphical-guide-for-understanding-uniswap/#resources","text":"Uniswap Whitepaper Uniswap \u2014 A Unique Exchange Improving front running resistance of x*y=k market makers","title":"Resources"},{"location":"guides/guide-to-ens/","text":"The Ultimate Guide to ENS Names This article initially appeared as a Medium post authored by Eric Conner . The Ethereum Name Service is one of the most popular projects on Ethereum right now and for good reason. As the website states , \"ENS offers a secure & decentralized way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.\" In short, you are able to give your Ethereum (or favorite chain ) address a name. This is much like how the traditional web works with DNS. All websites are hosted at an IP address but no one actually puts that in their browser, instead we use names such as amazon.com, not 205.251.242.103 (try it, it works!). The ENS has many great features but I'm going to focus this guide specifically on registering and managing .eth names and their subdomains. Registering .eth Domain Names The core functionality of the ENS is registering .eth domains. There are a few important rules to keep in mind when it comes to registering domains on the ENS: Minimum domain length is 3 characters. Annual renewal fees. 3 characters: $640/year, 4 characters: $160/year, 5+ characters $5/year. Emojis are valid. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Creating and Managing Domains Registering a domain is extremely easy using the ENS app . First search for the ENS name that you'd like. If it is not taken (if it is, head over to OpenSea and search for it), you will be presented with this screen. Once here you can click request to register which will trigger a transaction, wait 1 minute and then you can register the name. It's now yours. Now that you own a .eth domain, you want to enable all the cool features that it offers. This starts on the domain management screen. There is a lot going on so let's put all of the pieces together: Registrant: can set the controller address, and transfer the registration to someone else. This is the ultimate owner. Controller: essentially handles the \"day to day operations\" of the domain. Expiration Date: when your renewal fee is due and you can pay it here as well. Resolver: handles resolving (translating) the records put below such as what Ethereum address is tied to this domain. Should be set the public resolver which will be the default option when clicking the Set button. Records: this is where you can add the cool stuff to your domain. Put an address here so that when you put your domain name in a wallet, it points to this address. You can also put an IPFS content hash which when going to your domain in a web browser will pull up your website. Once you set an Ethereum address in the address field, it will resolve in wallets such as MetaMask. And if you point it to an IPFS hash, you can pull up the domain at ethhub.eth/ or ethhub.eth.link for browsers that don't resolve ENS names. Subdomains Subdomains offer great flexibility for building on top of .eth domains. If you are a company such as Maker and want to issue all your employees maker.eth subdomains, this is very easy to do. This section will cover both creating subdomains on a domain you own and unique ways of allowing others to buy subdomains on a domain you own. Creating and Managing Subdomains If you own a .eth domain and simply want to create subdomains for your own use, the easiest way to do this is through the ENS app by clicking on the Subdomains button. This is where you can add new subdomains. Once subdomains are setup, they act very similar to domains in that the owner can control them and setup records. That means something like eric.ethhub.eth can also resolve to an address and an IPFS website. Allowing Anyone to Claim Subdomains on your .eth Domain All of the above is being done by the registrant of the .eth domain. They are the one setting up the subdomains and have ultimate control over them, including being able to revoke them. This is fine for a company or someone that wants full control over the subdomains but what if you want anyone in the world to be able to claim a subdomain on your domain? You obviously don't want to have to coordinate with them and they won't want you to be able to revoke access. The good news is there is a solution that easily allows you to open up registration of subdomains on your domain. You can even set a price at which you'd like to sell them. Doing this starts with turning control of your domain over to the ENS Subdomain Registrar contract . This means that the contract is able to distribute out subdomains to people but you no longer can revoke access to those subdomains. The steps at the moment are fairly manual but also easy. Nick Johnson lays out the steps well in this ENSNow domains post so I'm going to just put them here: Warning: By doing this, you are permanently giving up use of your domain! You will be able to collect registration fees, change prices, and transfer control to another user\u200a-\u200abut you will never be able to use your domain for anything else! Load up the .eth registrar contract . If you are using Etherscan, you will need to click \"Connect with Metamask\" and authorize the subsequent dialog box from Metamask. Find the 'approve' function. In the address field, enter '0xc32659651d137a18b79925449722855aa327231d' In the tokenId field, enter the labelhash of your name. You can look this up by searching for your name on etherscan (look for 'Label hash [foo]:'). Submit the transaction. Load up the new subdomain registrar contract . Find the 'configureDomain' function. In the name field, enter the name you want to list, without '.eth' (Eg, 'gimmethe', not 'gimmethe.eth'). In the price field, enter the price to charge for a new domain, in wei. 1 ether is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei, so for instance to charge 0.01 ether per domain, you should enter 10000000000000000. A convertor can be found here . In the referralFeePPM field, enter the amount you want to give to any website that finds a new user for you. For instance, to keep the entire amount yourself, enter 0; to give it all to the site, enter 1000000. Submit the transaction. Your domain has now been handed over to the subdomain registrar contract. If you've set up a fee, anytime someone registers a subdomain, the funds will be directed to the original owner address. This has now opened up a lot of possibilities! Listing Your Subdomains on ENSNow The ENS team has setup a website which allows for claiming of subdomains. If you'd like your subdomains listed here the process is quite easy. Once again Nick has a blog post about the steps and I'm going to put them below: Go to this page and click 'fork' in the top right corner. Navigate to app -> js -> domains.json Click on the pencil icon in the top right corner of the file. Find the appropriate place to insert your entry (entries are listed alphabetically). Add a new line with your entry. If using the default registrar for steps 2 and 3, this should look like {\"name\": \"yourdomain\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}, . Commit your changes by clicking 'Commit changes' down the bottom of the page. Click on 'Pull requests', then 'New pull request'. Click on 'Create pull request'. Hosting Your Own Subdomain Sale Site ENSNow is great and easy, but the list of domains supported there is rather long and you cannot specifically brand your own domain. So, if you'd like to setup a site that only lists your domain and allows you to customize it, that is possible as well. A good example of this is a site I'm running called Ethmojis . The best place to start is on the Subdomain Registrar GitHub page . They have a \"getting started\" section which tells you how to run it but I'll try to summarize the steps up as best as I can below Install node.js and NPM Install Truffle on your computer using npm install -g truffle Download and install Ganache Clone the subdomain-registrar repo to your computer. In terminal, navigate to the folder you cloned it to and run npm install Find the /app/js/domains.json file and edit the whitelist to only include your domain. Mine looks like: [{\"name\": \"ethmojis\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}] Edit the index.html file however you'd like for your site. In terminal, change directory to where you cloned the subdomain registrar. Run: ganache-cli & truffle deploy npm run dev If everything looks goo, run npm run build A build folder should be created and files output here. This is your final site that you can upload to a web server or IPFS. To host on IPFS , upload the entire build folder and get your content hash. You can then put this content hash in the \"records\" section of any ENS domain or subdomain!

A: In phase 1 (about 2020 by my estimate) we will have shard data. Those shards, even without an EVM, can be used as the data availability layer for TrueBit (and other alternative execution engines). Phase 2 (about 2021) is when we will have scalable L1 execution. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: ELI5 execution engines Follow up A: An execution engine is a way to compute state assuming consensus on data. The execution engine for the EVM is \"naive re-execution\". There are more fancy execution engines such as TrueBit and SNARK/STARK-based validity proofs. [Justin Drake] Q: Are economists being consulted to help decide the issuance rate of a full POS system? Stated more broadly, who is helping/advising the ETH 2.0 team on the effects certain issuance decisions will have on the network and community (both in the short and long term)? A: Personally at this point the feedback I'm most interested in is actually feedback from potential stakers. The main question basically being, are there any other tweaks we can make to the economics that, given a fixed level of reward, will (i) encourage more people to validate, and (ii) encourage many small solo validators or smaller pools, as opposed to a few large pools. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Considering that Yoichi is not working anymore in the Foundation, what are your plans on formal verification of ETH 2.0 specs? A: I'd say that formal verification of the spec will make sense when the spec is more mature and stable, maybe mid 2019. Anyone interested in doing formal verification of the ETH 2.0 specs in a few months, please send a grant proposal. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the best response to a developer who is hesitant about building on ethereum today, given that it will be \"replaced\" by ETH 2.0 over the next few years? A: I expect that once the state and execution model for Serenity solidifies (see https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 for one minimal proposal) we'll start working with the developer community on modifications to high-level languages (Solidity, Vyper, etc) and best practices. Hopefully at that point it will become clearer how to build applications in such a way that they could be redeployed as-is on the 2.0 chain. At least that's my hope. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Building on Ethereum 1.0 today is great for learning and prototyping. It's also great for assembling a culturally-aligned team consistent with the philosophy of the Ethereum community (which may be different than the philosophy of the Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Tether, etc. communities). [Justin Drake] Q: Can we run multiple validator clients on a single machine assuming we've got multiple 32 Eth deposits? A: Yep! There's nothing preventing you from using one machine to run multiple validators. The only hard limit you'll face is that the number of shards you are assigned to validate increases linearly with the number of validator slots you have, so if you have thousands of ETH a laptop will not suffice and you'll need something more powerful. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Short answer: Yes. Long answer: You will need to register a validator for every 32 ETH. In phase 0 (just the beacon chain, no shards) you can likely handle thousands of validators on a single machine. After phase 1 the number of validators that can be operated on a single machine depends on how resourceful your machine is. A mainstream laptop should comfortably handle one validator, and likely handle 2-10 validators at max capacity. The computational resources scales linearly with the number of validators until you reach ~1,000 validators. At that point there are scalability advantages in being a super-node, i.e. a full node for every shard. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: How much importance are the devs placing on being able to run setups at home wrt keeping Ethereum decentralised and being able to move ETH in and out of staking pools? Follow up A: It's definitely a goal I care about. The alternative to staking at home is staking on AWS or staking through a pool, and both are risks for decentralization. Concrete ways we try to be friendly to staking at home: Relatively forgiving penalties for being offline, so you earn a net profit as long as you're online more than ~50-67% of the time Keeping the cost of validating the beacon chain low The anti-correlation penalty scheme, which more heavily penalizes validators that misbehave at the same time as many other validators (which is more likely if you're on the same pool or VPS or whatever). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: How can I help / get involved? I fell in love with Ethereum not too long ago. I\u2019ve been reading Zcash\u2019s BLS12-381 Elliptic Curves and for the past few days these are all thats been on my mind. I love this project now and just found ethresear.ch. I really wanna help in any way possible! Thanks again for all your hard work. I can\u2019t stop reading these posts. A: For researchers a good way to contribute and gain visibility is to post quality content on ethresear.ch. If you are a developer consider joining one of the numerous ETH2.0 implementation teams. [Justin Drake] A2: Hi! The best way to get involved is to find something that captures your interest and to dig in. Because Ethereum is a radically open platform, the research and development is also generally very open and very accessible. Keep reading. Follow your interests down all the little paths and begin to build a mental model of the ecosystem. https://ethresear.ch/ is a great place to follow and begin to contribute to research discussions. https://gitter.im/ethereum/sharding is where a lot of the day to day conversation about Serenity is happening (developers chatting from various projects) https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs Read the spec! but not only read it, be an active reader. If you find an error, typo, bug, etc, submit a PR. Also check out the issues and PRs in the spec repo. We are constantly discussing changes, fixes, updates and anyone can contribute. If you are a dev, open up one of the eth2.0 client projects and pick a \"good first issue\". These allow you to touch the codebase, contribute a bit, get the lay of the land, and provide the foundation to tackle bigger issues from there. ^ Those are Serenity specific suggestions, but beyond that, just find projects you are interested in and begin contributing. There is so much to do and project leads are always excited to have helping hands. This stuff doesn't build itself :) [Danny Ryan] A3: If you're interested in Cryptography especially, you can also check out another BLS - Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham signature spec for Serenity and help to review it: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/bls_signature.md :) For research, as Justin and Danny said, ethresear.ch is the sanctuary. And first, you can take a look the various topics on Ethereum Sharding Research Compendium to see which area you're most interested in. For implementation, there are multiple topics: Consensus layer - implement the spec! P2P layer design and implementation - see https://github.com/ethresearch/p2p [Hsiao-Wei Wang] Q: From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside. Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)? For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse. A: Cross-shard communication will definitely be slow at base layer, however there are higher-level mechanisms that can be used to implement fast cross-shard communication on top of a base layer that allows any cross-shard communication at all even if slow. See https://ethresear.ch/t/a-layer-2-computing-model-using-optimistic-state-roots/4481 for an example of how this could be done. In general, I expect a lot of the long-run innovation in improving the smart contract development experience to happen at higher levels in this way; I write about why this is a good idea at length here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What happens to all the contracts currently running? A: It is somewhat speculative at this point. My best guess is that Ethereum 1.0 contracts will stay running as-is for a long time (say, 10+ years) without any migration to Ethereum 2.0. This can be made sustainable by doing two things: Lower the inflation (e.g. reduce it by 20x, bringing the PoW security to a blockchain such as Ethereum Classic). Completely removing inflation\u2014relying on transaction fees only\u2014would also be possible (see below for security argument). Use Ethereum 2.0 to regularly finalise Ethereum 1.0, counter-balancing the reduced security and preventing long-range 51% attacks. This requires Ethereum 1.0 nodes to be beacon chain light clients, which should take years to happen. If the community gets tired of Ethereum 1.0 a bomb mechanism (e.g. difficulty bomb, issuance bomb, gas bomb, etc.) can gracefully kill it. Another possibility is for Ethereum 1.0 to become a contract on Ethereum 2.0. I don't see this as a practical solution, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise :) [Justin Drake] A follow up: I'll add that if any specific user wants to migrate their application to the 2.0 chain, then they should be able to just take their existing high-level code (Solidity or Vyper), make relatively few changes and redeploy. The main difference between the eth1 and eth2 systems that users will need to worry about is likely to be rent (or equivalents like gas-payment-extended bounded TTLs). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there a worry that shards will become \u201cgentrified\u201d until full shard interoperability? Basically, will one shard capture all the defi apps because they can't directly communicate with each other on separate shards? A: I would say if that happens, that will create a large incentive for someone to create a defi dapp that can interact with the other defi dapps through asynchronous cross-shard transactions and launch it on a cheaper shard. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: At the start in times of low usage, the economic load-balancing might result in over and under utilized shards. Overtime as usage increases, I expect the economic benefits of deploying and interacting on particular shards will become more tangible and result in a more economically rational distribution across shards. Observing the emergent behavior is going to be super fascinating :) [Danny Ryan] Q: Can we run the same validator on multiple machines - in order to avoid penalties if one machine was compromised ? If yes - what happens when we run a validator on 3 machines, one goes temporary offline, one is compromised, one is OK? A: For small amounts of ETH I'd recommend just running on one machine; unless many other validators get penalized at the same time as you, the penalties are not too large. If you do want to decentralize your validator, then we have recently made progress toward validation being more multi-party-computation friendly, which would allow you to run a validator as a 2-of-3. In that case, as long as two of the three sub-nodes are functioning correctly you'll be fine. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Yes! Ethereum 2.0 is friendly to n-of-m schemes thanks to BLS signatures. For example, with a 2-of-3 scheme you have can three computers, each with a share of the validator private key, such that two need to be online at any given time. This improves security as well, because an attacker now needs to compromise two of the BLS key shares. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there tech from any competitors such as Dfinity (or any others) that is worth adopting into Ethereum 2.0, or is the work all other dapp/smart contract platforms doing not relevant/good enough for ETH 2.0? A: Part of the job of the research team is to absorb good ideas from research papers and other blockchain projects. I keep a keen eye on technically interesting projects such as Dfinity, Coda, Zcash, etc. Competitors definitely also have good ideas, and learning from each other is part of the game :) [Justin Drake] Q: Do we need to run a full node to also earn from network fees or would the validator client handle this? A: Depends what you mean by \"full node\". The design of the sharding system is such that no one needs to run a node that verifies all of the data of all of the shards. A validator client validates the beacon chain and the specific shards that you get assigned to validate, and that is sufficient to earn network fees. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: The validator client should abstract the necessary tasks to get revenue from the different revenue streams. (This includes being a full node for the beacon chain and one shard at any given time, but that's a technicality you don't have to worry about.) [Justin Drake] Q: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. It's also the thing that scares me the most about the proposed design;i can see how they would really increase the security of the random sample selection process in addition to RANDAO but manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? A: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. We're working our way with various partners, including Synopsys, AWS, TSMC, GUC, etc. VDF announcements to come in February :) manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. Right. The good news is that Ethereum 2.0 can launch just fine without VDFs, so we're not betting Ethereum 2.0 on the success of VDFs. The current plan is to have VDF hardware ready in 2020, but 2021 would also be acceptable. From a financial perspective, we may share the total costs (estimated at $15m) with Filecoin and other projects interested in VDFs. We are already sharing costs with Filecoin on viability studies. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? Short answer: yes, of course :) Long answer: the ethresear.ch post provides a bit of clarity on that. highly specialized hw always connected providing a crucial function to the network it would be a prime target for potential adversaries to disrupt or compromise Right. The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to be online for normal operation, and even if everyone goes down it's not a huge deal. The main negative consequence is that dApps relying on unbiasable randomness will have to wait longer than expected for the random numbers to arrive. [Justin Drake] Q: zk-STARKs are powerful and I have been reading Eli\u2019s and the others paper on it. Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? I know Coda is planning on using Recursive zk-SNARKs to shrink chains but the lack of transparency is worrying. A: I don't see what fundamentally prevents them from happening. Recursive [any zero knowledge proof schemme] just means using the ZKP mechanism to make a ZKP of the ZKP's own verification procedure. The main challenge in practice is just that these verification procedures themselves have a high cost (eg. there's 50-500 kB worth of hashes in a STARK to verify), and this cost multiplied by the ZKP's overhead is quite a big number. ZK SNARK verification is in contrast much more \"concise\". [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? In theory yes, but as I understand recursive zk-STARKs won't make sense from a performance standpoint for most applications, at least in the medium term. [Justin Drake] Q: What\u2019s the final scalability limit of Ethereum post Serenity? Gas limits per block? Blocks per second? A: The current design has a fixed number of shards, at most one block per 6-second slot, and fixed block sizes. This means that the data bandwidth is capped. The gas limit on the other hand will likely be floating, just like Ethereum 1.0. [Justin Drake] A follow up: Though in the current phase 1 spec that's sitting around in draft mode the block size is so far fixed to 16 kB, as keeping it fixed makes the code for proofs of custody, data availability proofs, etc much simpler. If we want to bump up capacity later increasing the shard count may well be the simpler way to do it. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why should anyone move to the Beacon Chain? How exactly do you envision the move to happen? A: Why should anyone move to the beacon chain. Specifically, only validator balances exist in the Beacon Chain. User balances and state exist in the shard chains. Validators will move to the beacon chain to seek profit by providing security and resources to network. Note there is a new proposal to have the beacon chain finalize the PoW chain during the transition period so the validators would be able to provide security both to the new shards and the existing chain. Users will move to the shard chains to participate in the new scalable, sharded landscape. We envision economic activity to begin to move over as the system stabilizes and begins to show clear economic benefits to the users. It is important to note that a user could choose to not move until the eth1.0 state is rolled into a shard. How exactly do you envision the move to happen? At first, this will just be a single directional deposit for validators only to begin validation. Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer eth directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards. The current most favorable strategy from our perspective is to fork the PoW state root into a contract along with an EVM interpreter. Users could then execute txs on the existing eth1.0 state by call the contract along with the merkle witnesses of the state they need to access. This option is nice because it allows us to cleanly deprecate eth1.0 support in the long term. [Danny Ryan] A2: Moving to the beacon chain is done by sending ETH to a so-called \"deposit contract\" on Ethereum 1.0. People would send ETH to the beacon chain to become an Ethereum 2.0 validator and gain financial rewards. [Justin Drake] Q: How much funds does Ethereum foundation have and are these enough for finishing Eth 2.0? A: The EF has tens of millions of dollars in fiat, and a bunch of ETH. More than enough to finish ETH 2.0 :) [Justin Drake] Q: How is the status of a possibly fixed eth supply at some point in the future? Do you think it's likely? A: I don't know about fixed ETH supply, but we may get to a point of decreasing ETH supply. Indeed, we are looking into transaction fee schemes that burn ETH, and burnt ETH may outweigh minted ETH. [Justin Drake] Q: Have you looked into hyraxZK. They are zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup. Any thoughts on them being used in the future as the sizes are still very small. The only thing is they wouldnt be Quantum-Resistant but the proof size won\u2019t be similar to a zk-STARK. I wonder what they can be used for offchain as well, especially in networking by producing a zk proof of incoming packets that acts as Natural DDOS Protection. Just some thoughts. A: Have not looked into Hyrax specifically, but I am totally not surprised that things like it exist. I'm definitely very happy with the progress the general-purpose ZKP space has accomplished in the last few years; the very concept of general-purpose ZKP is pretty godlike compared to what I imagined was possible with cryptography as a child. Our general instinct is to find ways to make it possible to get the benefits of many different ZKP schemes with different tradeoffs in ethereum. The simplest way to do this would be to encourage the development of such tech as application-layer or network-layer addons so that it we do not need an agreement at consensus layer about a single ZKP scheme that everyone uses. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: V said that there are no fundamental problems left to solve. Is this true for only phase 0? If so, how confident are you about the other phases? A: Personally I am confident in all of the current fundamental technologies for all the phases outlined so far (Casper FFG and CBC, sharding, erasure coded data availability proofs, proofs of custody, receipt-based async transactions, layer 2 for acceleration, abstraction, rent, \"stateless client\" verification). There is definitely still a lot of room around the edges for optimization though. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why was Hybrid Casper ditched when it looks like the Beacon Chain kind of has nothing to do with the PoW chain? or Why not re-instate Hybrid Casper considering its testing is/was finalized? A: Honestly hybrid Casper is a bit of a dead end. Actually implementing/testing it across all the clients would require setting up a lot of infrastructure that we would then need to throw away. The design was highly inefficient because of its \"implemented-in-EVM\" nature, and it turned out that we could not really benefit from the ease-of-implementability of being done in EVM because we would need to write a lot of special-purpose code to make verification of signatures parallelizable. So we chose the route that would be somewhat more painful in the short term, but significantly lower headache to actually get to a stable sharded system overall. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: I wrote up some notes on the deprecation of EIP 1011 here https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rJDrKoBOQ [Danny Ryan] Q: 1. Since it is a one way transfer to the beacon chain, my understanding is that there will be two tokens: ETH1.0 and ETH2.0. Right? Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? Gutfeeling: how much \"unsolved computer science problems\" for phase 1, 2 and 3 roughly? I understood for phase zero it has arrived at 0. Will we consider some kind of tax baked into the system to ensure sustainability of core developments and infrastructure? A: Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? ETH in the beacon chain would not be transferable (anywhere!) until phase 2. That will make exchanges harder, although we may see a futures' market. My guess is that we will see 1 ETH ~ 1 BETH at pretty much all times :) [Justin Drake] My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? The reward/penalty constants are certainly not yet finalized and could use more community debate and input. That said, the rate does scale depending on the number of validators participating. If the fair market rate is really 20%, then a lower number of validators will show up. If the fair rate is 2%, then a ton of validators will show up. The economics of staking will find the natural equilibrium. That said the main risk here is if we set the target rate too low and the equilibrium lands at a low participation rate (and thus low security of the network). Although ~2% (@ 10M eth validating) is not set in stone, the idea for a low rate is that a huge amount of ETH is already being held as a speculative asset. Any marginal rate of return on top of this already intended long-term hodling is a gain for the hodler. [Danny Ryan] Q: How would you (and or service providers) ensure the eth on the Beacon Chain is the same as that on the PoW chain and vice versa? A: Arbitrage is always possible in one direction by buying 1 BETH for 1 ETH. A key design goal of Ethereum 2.0 is full fungibility for ETH tokens between the Ethereum 1.0 chain, the beacon chain, and the shards. Two-way transfers between the beacon chain and the shards, as well as between shards, should come in phase 2. [Justin Drake] Follow up point: If you wait until phase 2 for two-way flow, you privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money. This will be great for those few (probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. Follow up A: y ou privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money The ultimate loyalty test :) probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. We do have a minimum amount at stake to launch phase 0, around 214 * 32 ETH = 524,288 ETH. So we're effectively capping the interest rate (will be less than 25%) and setting a minimum security level. [Justin Drake] Q: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? A: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? At least as long as you are a validator. Withdrawal times should be a few days/weeks/months depending on how many other validators are trying to withdraw. What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? You can switch machines. You need a copy of your private keys in case your machine gets destroyed or stolen. Another thing is the withdrawal key used for withdrawals only. Keep that one in cold storage ideally. [Justin Drake] Q: Contributing to Ethereum 2.0? Are there any projects which are some sort of \"under water\", like only few people working on it. A: I feel at this point there are enough implementation teams, at least compared to some of the other issues that are underaddressed. Off the top of my head: Solidity being compile-able to E-WASM Vyper being compile-able to E-WASM Thinking about research problems related to phase 2, particularly around account abstraction, asynchronous contract programming models, etc Privacy, eg. see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-we-should-value-privacy-more/2475 Improving the state of decentralized messaging and file storage [Vitalik Buterin] Follow up A: A few more things good to work on: liibp2p implementations in various languages Doing security reviews of the spec prototyping account and state execution in eWASM a lot of work in cross client testing coming up in the next couple of months [Danny Ryan] Q: We have experienced consecutive delays with Constantinople due to bugs found late in the process on a comparatively low risk / simple upgrade. What work is being done to mitigate this on Phase 0 and 1 given how much more complex these implementations will be? (I.e. What testing, third party audits, other considerations are being taken to ensure seamless implementation/integration? A: As the phase 0 spec is moving into a more stable place, we are beginning to look into explicitly bringing in third party audits, academics, and formal analysis. In addition to this, we are currently laying down the foundations of cross client testing and fuzzing akin to eth1.0. You're correct in that the consensus/system layer of eth2.0 is much more complex than the single PoW chain so we are constantly trying to reduce complexity and simplify. This is a major engineering effort that will require many parties other than our research team to plan, build, test, execute, and maintain. I think it is a major strength that so many independent teams with a diverse set of expertise have stepped up to contribute. Note, one of the design goals in the spec readme -- \"to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency\" We're excited to see new efforts like the \"Ethereum Cat Herders\" and scheduled release cycles emerging in 1.0 and plan to incorporate any best practices and efforts into the 2.0 process. DePM (decentralized project management) is hard, but we continue to learn and continue to get better. [Danny Ryan] Q: How difficult will it be for 1.0 contracts to work on Serenity? Should developers expect to rewrite their contracts to account for state rent and cross-shard communication? A: Solidity can already compile to WASM and I believe it is in Vyper's roadmap to do so as well. These naive compilations might be inefficient (e.g. keeping 256 bit types in the 64bit wasm machine) so some amount of rewrite or utilization of optimizers might be called for. Beyond that, there are some unknowns that might change the approach to certain contract programming modesl. For example, storage fees might call for a new ERC20 contract design in which user balances are stored in separate child contracts so that users become responsible for managing their own storage fees related to their coins. [Danny Ryan] Q: What is the latest view on how the \"upgrade\" to Ethereum 2.0 will happen? Can you take us through the different phases/hardforks that will in the end enable the full PoS/sharded/WASM blockchain, and what each will enable? A: Eth2.0 is broadly divided into three phases -- Phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase 0 - The Beacon Chain This phase is the launch of the core system level functionality of the new PoS chain (the beacon chain). Validators can submit deposits, join the validator set, and build/finalize the core chain. At this point the chain will have Casper finality, an RNG, shuffling into the various validator roles, and simulate crosslinking in the (currently) non-existent shard chains. Phase 1 - Shard Chains (data) This phase is the launch of the shard chains, but only as a blockchain of data. (Execution and state comes in phase 2). At this point, validators will additionally build these data chains and finalize the each shard back into the beacon chain via \"crosslinks\" and attest the availability of the data. These crosslinks were already being created in Phase 0, but had a stub for the shard hash being finalized. In this phase, that hash becomes \"unstubbed\". Shard data chains begin to have some utility for applications that need a high availability data store. Phase 2 - Shard Chains (state and execution) This phase is the launch of state and execution of state (eWASM) on the shard chains. This is when users and applications will begin to migrate to Serenity and use it to it's full potential. Cross shard txs will be available at this point, and users can begin developing any number of \"layer 2\" execution engines on top. The above (especially phase 2) might be divided into sub-forks, and there will be a fork during/after phase 2 to bring in the eth1.0 state/evm into a contract. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm quoting James' article: \"This means there will be little reason to migrate smart contract code or users until Phase 4 is released, potentially in the mid-2020s\". Does this mean, ETH2.0 wont be usable before 2025? \"ETH2.0 designers do not know what the cross-shard communication system will look like.\" If you're so unsure about the features of ETH2.0, why is it being developed at all? What will be the advantages in daily use compared to EHT1.X? Why should anyone wait till \"the mid-2020s\" to use ETH2.0? A: 2025 sounds... unlikely! I publicly made the prediction (since July 2018) that phases 0, 1, 2 will come in 2019, 2020, 2021 respectively. Scaling from shards will come in phase 1 and phase 2. On the topic of timelines, for phase 0 specifically, ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses for phase 0. [Justin Drake] A2: I answered a related question here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeufhqb [Danny Ryan] Q: https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd From the article above, this is what I understand as the timeline of Ethereum 2.0: Phase 0 will be available in year 2020 Phase 1 will be available in 2022 Phase 2 will be available in 2023/24 Given the above timeline, is it fair to say that DAPP's have to wait at least 4 years before they can run their smart contracts on top of Ethereum 2.0? A: Hi! That article is written by an independent engineer that has been following development so it is not necessarily our 1-to-1 opinion. That said, I'm only seeing the following in the article -- \"Which is to say, while ETH2.0 may launch this year, don\u2019t expect ETH2.0 to support asset transfer or smart contracts until at least 2020.\" I agree that assets and smart contracts won't be available in eth2.0 in 2019. At the latest, I expect phase 2 to launch in 2021, but we are building a complex system and can't say for sure what unexpected challenges might arise between now and then. Waiting until 2023/24 is entirely out of the question for phase 2 imo. [Danny Ryan] Q: With eWASM will we be able to write contracts in Rust and/or any language that compiles to WASM in addition to Solidity? Where can one find out more about that and/or potentially help out? Thanks :) A: Yes you will be able to write contracts in any language that compiles to WASM :) I expect specific toolkits/frameworks to spring up in the languages people are particularly interested in (e.g. Rust, go, typescript, etc) to aid in writing contracts in these languages. https://github.com/ewasm/design is a great place to get started. The eWASM team has compiled a ton of info here to understand the project from a high level. https://gitter.im/ewasm/Lobby The eWASM team and broader community congregate in this gitter room and I'm sure would be willing to provide more guidance and answer any questions you have. [Danny Ryan] Q: Hi guys, Would you like to implement an optional decentralized identity layer in the future? like an option to use DID's or something. so the user can use zero knowledge proofs for Dapps that requires some proof of credentials of the user. Greetz A: Decentralized identity systems are definitely very interesting, but imo out-of-scope for blockchain base layers. The good news is that it's a Turing-complete platform, so anyone can build one on top of ethereum (1.0 or 2.0), and yes that are teams working on different approaches to it already. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What is the one thing on eth 2.0 dev that keeps you up at night? A: In my mind the Ethereum 2.0 abstract design is a remarkably elegant/slick/simple design. I worry that we botch the spec with poor taste in some of the implementation details, or bugs that we miss. [Justin Drake] Q: How will the Eth1.0/PoW chain eventually be migrated over? A: See the bottom of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeucd4f tldr, fork into a stateless contract on a shard [Danny Ryan] A2: See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ [Justin Drake] Q: What are the current incentives for a person to run their own beacon node? A: It is a similar set of incentives as why you would run an eth1.0 node -- mining, run applications (block explorer, wallet services, dapp portal, etc), hobbyists wanting direct connection to the network, etc. If you are a validator, you will receive rewards for operating a node and signing consensus messages. If you run some sort of application, it can be beneficial to run a beacon chain to directly sync the shards you need. You also might serve light clients and applications as a business. I fully expect some some entities to experiment with this model. If you are a hobbyist, you might just like running the protocol directly for self-sovereignty :) [Danny Ryan] A2: Financial rewards through ETH inflation. I think Eric Conner has a spreadsheet somewhere. See https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1070713152864583682 for example here\u2014numbers presented here likely on the low side. [Justin Drake] Q: How do the researchers and developers feel about the complexity of ETH 2.0? A: We're definitely trying hard to bring the complexity down! Examples of complexity decreases that we've made in the last ~3 months include: Switching FFG from the \"per-block finalization\" model to a simpler epoch-based model Moving shard committee calculation outside the state Replacing the RANDAO hash onion construction with a simpler BLS construction (and same with the hash onion for proofs of custody) Storing validator state change slots in the validator record, making each validator's state transition process much more understandable Making shard blocks fixed size rather than variable size (which allows removing a lot of boilerplate for handling transitions) That said we recognize that there's still a way to go, and many features of eth2 don't feel neat and clean the way eg. Nakamoto PoW does. I personally hope a medium-term switch to Casper CBC (see https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/12/05/cbc_casper.html ) can mitigate some of that. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there any work being done on reducing the size of the blockchain as it grows? A: You mean the current chain or the 2.0 chain? Since this AMA is primarily about on the 2.0 chain I'll focus on that. The beacon chain state size is bounded, and there are no objects that hang around forever; even validator records disappear once either their balance drops too low or the validators exit voluntarily and then the withdrawal and exit waiting periods pass. On the shard chains, we're looking at ongoing storage maintenance fees for every byte of storage, \"hibernating\" accounts that do not pay up (at which point their users are responsible for storing and maintaining the data needed to revive those accounts if they need them). [Vitalik Buterin] A2: If you are talking about the Ethereum 1.0 chain size there are a number of workgroups in place and some of them deal with decreasing the chain state or slowing down chain state growth. See: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-ring-to-discuss-and-coordinate-all-ethereum-1x-efforts/2048 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-1-dot-x-a-half-baked-roadmap-for-mainnet-improvements/1995 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/state-rent-proposal-version-2-rushed/2494 [Hudson Jameson] Q: Inter-shard transactions - how do downstream shards protect themselves against kiting exploits (A->B B->C C->D where the transfer A->B is later challenged)?? I can imagine kiting tumblers that might make this a computationally intractable challenge. A: There isn't really a concept of \"challenging transfers\" in the current spec, and if you mean plain old fraud proofs then the answer is that if a block that was confirmed into a history turns out to be invalid then the entire history from that point on is invalid and should get discarded. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: If I deploy a contract in ETH 2.0 will it randomly be assigned to a shard? A: No. You specify the shard you want. You'll chose based on proximity to contracts of interest, and gas prices. (Each shard will have a separate gas market.) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though initial choice is not necessarily irreversible; contracts could be designed to be yanked ( https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450 ) from one shard to another, and I expect a lot of applications will take advantage of this feature. Q: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? Also, will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? A: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? A software implementation of the VDF would likely be useless for production. The current estimate is that a CPU implementation would be 1,000 to 10,000 times slower than the ASIC. A software implementation would be useful for testing though. will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? There will be a small incentive for validators to also be VDF evaluators. Other than that we're mostly drawing from external incentives (e.g. as a large ETH holder you have an incentive that Ethereum stays healthy). The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to do its job. There will be thousands of VDF rigs given for free to the community. [Justin Drake] Q: Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds and can they cause collisions with old contracts? A: One of the features of Ethereum 2.0 is \"abstraction\", which means that users can specify whatever signature scheme they want. I expect quantum-secure signature schemes to gradually become more popular. Burn addresses can easily be made quantum-secure. Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds Yes, definitely a threat. Ownerless legacy address could be a systemic risk for blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Would be interesting to guestimate how much ETH is at risk. Q: ERC20/721 standards' design sucks. Is there any idea or plan to convert current tokens to ERC-1155 like, efficient format? (Code isn't Law. Seriously.) A: I'm hoping that Ethereum 2.0 standards (such as token standards) can learn from the mistakes of Ethereum 1.0 and evolve. Starting from scratch is a unique opportunity in Ethereum's lifetime. [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Agree! There's a lot from ERC20 that I dislike, the main two things being: It being a pull system vs a push system, requiring the whole approve/transferFrom mess to use tokens to pay for things in smart contracts Handling of ETH being so different from handling of tokens Definitely would like to see both issues resolved in 2.0. The other big things I want to \"get right this time\" is (i) multisig wallets and (ii) not having the \"ether used to pay for gas to withdraw funds from a mixer contract being a deanonymization vector\" issue that makes privacy hard at the moment. Q: How soon will staking pools be live when Ethereum staking goes live? A: At the consensus layer we are trying hard to be friendly to decentralised staking pools. Hopefully we will see those soon after the launch of phase 0. The research and implementation work that Dfinity is doing regarding BLS Distributed Key Generation (DKG) will likely help decentralised pools. Centralised staking pools\u2014unlike centralised mining pools\u2014are somewhat awkward because you have to trust the operator to behave properly with your funds. [Justin Drake] Q: If we want to bring our smart contracts to a new chain, could we pre-determine the corresponding starting/ending hex values for the old smart contracts? Kind of reminds me of CREATE2... A: Yes, Eth2.0 will have a CREATE2 equivalent for deploying contracts. As for existing contracts, the entire eth1.0 state will be rolled into a contract on a shard and these existing contracts will be callable via calling into this 1.0 contract targeting the existing contract address. [Danny Ryan] Q: Are there any courses or subjects in uni that one should take to help in becoming a researcher? A: I'd say you need to be a good self-learner. Math, cryptography, computer science, programming, economics, networking are all relevant. [Justin Drake] Q: Of proposed ways to tackle state rent problem, which one is your favorite? What do you think about resulting complexity from user point of view? A: As far as base protocol goes, either option here: https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 The complexity is actually not so much in the rent itself, it's in how it changes the developer experience. The general approach is that application storage will need to be more \"modular\" and explicitly broken down into chunks associated with specific users, possibly with a fixed amount of \"global\" storage, plus some short-term storage not assigned to any user that goes away after some fixed amount of time, eg. 6 months. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Question for Justin Drake and other VDF researchers: Would using Chainlink and TEEs (Intel SGX) be a viable method of generating secure randomness for the VDF function of Eth 2.0? Could this be used in lieu of specialized hardware? If so, I imagine this could be a substantial time and cost saving measure in the quest for Serenity. A: TEEs can be used to generate randomness using delay. Unfortunately TEEs is trusted hardware. We need a trustless solution :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though I would add that trusted hardware could be a great thing for individual validators to use to increase their security. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What computer science problems still need to be solved prior to the release of Phase 1? A: For phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. Please message me if that sounds like your cup of tea :) [Justin Drake] Q: What happens to the beacon chain in the event of a controversial hardfork on the Eth 1.0 chain? Will two beacon chains form? If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? How will this affect the transition of the Eth 1.0 chain onto a Eth 2.0 shard? What safeguards are in place to ensure that malicious participants do not create unnecessary volatility between ETH & BETH during the year long transition from phase 0 to phase 2? It is my view that this trading pair must remain stable for a successful transition to take place. A: If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? By default the beacon chain validators will just use the voting mechanism that's specified in the spec, and whichever chain a majority of the validators support is the chain that the beacon chain will go with. That said, if we want to facilitate a peaceful split, there is a fork versioning feature built in to the beacon chain to make replay protection very easy... [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why are you not doing \"proper\" research and submit publications to conferences? A: Not really an answer to your question, but Ethresear.ch ( https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=\"ethresear.ch\"&btnG=&oq=\"et ) does get cited :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: As does the Casper FFG paper! [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Let's say that I have some ethereum locked on a time locked contract, will be available after the 2.0 transition? This question can be expanded to all 1.0 contract functionality after the POS transition A: The Ethereum 1.0 will live on, even after Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. See https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ . [Justin Drake] Q: Thoughts on this tweet? https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/1088001513459511296?s=21 A: Eth 2.0 is not really trying to maintain backwards compatibility; almost every part of the design is significantly altered, and old contracts will have to explicitly migrate over to the new system and in some cases rewrite eg. to adapt to rent. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What's your vision for Eth 3.0? A: STARKs, STARKs and lots of STARKs. Hopefully some nice way to achieve 2 second average block times. Extremely effective cross-shard communication, either at base layer or through a variety of easy-to-use layer 2 systems. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: See https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1072593728253104128 [Justin Drake] Q: In the future how will a really popular DAPP operate? Will it be possible for a single DAPP to operate across multiple shards? If not how will it operate properly with the TX/sec limits on a single shard? Will L2 solutions be the only option? A: A dApp would have to get really big to consume all the resources in a given shard to justify spreading itself over multiple shards. For example, Uber does less than 20 rides per second. A similarly popular decentralised equivalent would likely fit on a single shard, especially when fancy L2 infrastructure is involved (e.g. state channels, plasma, SNARKs/STARKs). [Justin Drake] Q: What is your take on the current state of finding consensus on randomness, in particular the current VDF construction. While certainly clever, I wouldn't say it is very elegant. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? More general, are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) A: I wouldn't say it is very elegant I'd say VDFs are a super elegant thin layer on top of RANDAO :) Is it the hardware you don't like? If so, would you agree that proof-of-work is an elegant solution? Then think of VDFs as being \"proof-of-work 2.0\": much better randomness at much lower cost. It's a paradigm shift from massively-parallel work to inherently-sequential work. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? I'm not aware of any unbiasable randomness schemes that only have strong liveness, other than VDFs :) are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) We will have an academic \"VDF day\" at Stanford on Feb 3 to work on open problems. Will you be nearby? [Justin Drake] Q: Shouldn't the smart contract stated in (4) have the ability of sending just 16 ETH for something as RocketPool v2 work (while some consider this to be \"centralization\" I think it will help a lot the average user and mitigate the risk of the average user)? A: You can send between 1 ETH and 32 ETH to the Ethereum 1.0 deposit contract at any time. A minimum balance of 32 ETH on the beacon chain is required for activation as a validator. [Justin Drake] Q: I see a lot of people talking about nodes running in cloud. Shouldn't ETH find a way to actually discourage this? If everybody is running nodes in cloud that means we have possible single point of failure, which is against what I think we are trying to achieve and what enterprise customers are looking to eliminate. A: \"Partial slashing\" and the quadratic leak during times of no-finality actually financially encourage diverse validator setups. Your potential losses are much smaller when your slashable message or validator down-time are discorrelated. Diversity in setup includes -- node software, validation software, local server vs cloud provider (and which cloud if using cloud), geographic region, etc. If a ton of validators all run on AWS and AWS goes down, these validators will suffer large penalty leaks. To guard against this, I should setup my validation node locally or on a less used cloud provider. [Danny Ryan] A2: We do have a way! It's called \"partial slashing\" and the idea is that, if something goes wrong, the more people did something wrong the more everyone gets penalised. So there is an incentive to avoid correlation with other validators, and hence avoid centralisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Can you foresee ever having to move Eth 1.0 to Eth 2.0 in order to avoid losing it forever? A: The current plan is to incorporate the eth1.0 state into a contract on a shard in eth2.0. Note that this will just be a state root and an EVM interpreter along with eth balances. Users will be able to call into this contract by providing merkle witnesses of the required state. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm a new developer looking into Ethereum, where would you officially recommend I look to develop with an eye toward future proofing? A: A key consideration to future proof your contract code for Ethereum 2.0 is sustainable storage. It's known as \"storage rent\" and \"storage maintenance fees\". [Justin Drake] Q: What do you guys think of the Avalanche consensus mechanism and could it play a role in the ETH roadmap further into the future? A: Avalanche is interesting to me because it's a fresh approach. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out with Bitcoin Cash. Successes there can be ported to Ethereum via L2 infrastructure. [Justin Drake] Q: Is sharding smart contracts theoretically possible? How would one go about that? A: Here's a trivial example: the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be sharded across n shards according to the first log_2(n) bits in the domain name hash. [Justin Drake] Q: How does eth 2.0 balance security across shards holding different amounts of notional value in them? For example if there is a decentralized finance shard holding a very high % of eth + other tokens, would the stakers/validators responsible for that shard have incentives to behave badly? A: The key security guarantee of sharding comes from frequently shuffling validators into randomly-sampled committees (known as \"crosslink committees\"). The hope is that this fast shuffling resists bribing attacks, in both the \"honest majority\" and the \"slowly-adaptive rational majority\" security models. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: It still seems like an inefficiency where you'd be over-securing shards with low notional value + under-securing shards with high notional value. Am I thinking about this wrong? A: Every shard gets security with the same notional value. Value (validator collateral) gets spread evenly across shards. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: Ah think we are speaking past each other a bit, let me try to clarify my concern --> It seems likely you will have wildly varying ratios of (value sitting atop a particular shard / validator collateral securing that shard). So for example a defi shard with 90% of value in eth economy sitting in it only gets 1/1024th of the validator collateral securing it. And an empty or unused shard would get same 1/1024th of total validator collateral securing it. This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? A: This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? Oh I see! Interesting point. We consider every shard equal, and provide high security for all shards. The breakdown of even a single shard (namely, an unavailable or invalid crosslink) would likely be catastrophic for the whole system. [Justin Drake] Q: Will the Beacon Chain require its own nodes? Is this basically a brand new chain that has only one connection to ethereum: Proof of Burn? A: The beacon chain is a new system level chain that houses the validators and manages their responsibilities and rewards/penalties. In many ways this is akin to the FFG contract and sharding contract proposals that were previously deprecated but the organization breaks clean from the EVM to allow for a radically new design and increased efficiency. A node in the future can run the PoW chain and/or the beacon chain. If they run the beacon chain, they can then sync whatever shard chains they want. The connection at first is just an economic connection -- use the existing economics and community to seed validation in the beacon chain. Beyond that, we expect the beacon chain to be used to finalize the pow chain in the short to medium term. In the end, there are a number of proposals to either fork the eth1.0 state into eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: How does Eth 2.0 account for DDOS attacks? If people run nodes at home on consumer hardware with a normal internet connection they can be taken offline easily with DDOS attacks or am I interpreting this wrong? A: It is the responsibility of a validator to remain online to fulfill their responsibilities and gain rewards. A validator can remain profitable if they generally remain online greater than 50-67% of the time. A validator's inactivity penalties are also minimized if their being offline is dis-correlated from other validators. This incentivizes to utilize different node and validation software from the majority so that in the case of a ddos attack vector against a particular node implementation, your offline losses are minimized. The validator's protocol level identity and it's node's network identity are completely decoupled. This allows for a validator to create any type of obfuscated network setup that serves their purposes. I expect many tools and best practices to arise for home validators in the coming months. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are your thoughts on formal verification of smart contracts? Will this be possible with Ethereum 2.0? A: Formal verification of smart contracts is awesome and super valuable IMO. Formal verification will be possible in eth2.0. I believe the WASM semantics are already available in K which will provide some good opportunities for contract verification. Opening up more languages by using WASM will also allow for utilization of more restricted languages that are more amenable to FV. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are some good cypherpunk books that you would recommend to people getting interested in this space? (Or just good book recommendations in general) A: I don't read many books nowadays. I mostly consume academic papers, whitepapers, podcasts, videos, blog posts, Reddit, Twitter, etc. I did enjoy \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel when I was an entrepreneur. [Justin Drake] **Q: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? How are you solving the fast state syncing problem if nodes need to be reshuffled around shards? A: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? By randomly shuffling validators across shards. Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? Right now crosslink committees are shuffled every epoch (6.4 minutes) and shard proposer committees are shuffled every ~9 days. Crosslink committees are critical, hence why there are shuffled fast. See this answer also. [Justin Drake] Q: You said in a comment some days ago that there are basically no unsolved problems of Serenity Phase 0 left. Which problems of Phase 1 and 2 are still left to be solved? A: The short answer is there are no big fundamental problems for phases 0, 1, 2. The more detailed answer is that for phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. For phase 2 we need to figure out sustainable storage. [Justin Drake] Q: Before Eth 2.0 Enhancements come in, what is the best recommended approach for storing private data on Ehereum? A: Storing data on Ethereum is expensive per byte. Infrastructure like Filecoin may prove to be a good trustless storage solution. For privacy, just encrypt the data. [Justin Drake] Q: Will there be any zk-snarks related enhancements coming with Eth 2.0? A: We are hoping to have a SNARK- and STARK-friendly hash function in Ethereum 2.0 at some point. Unfortunately those likely won't be ready for phase 0. At the application layer, WASM will ideally mean that SNARK-specific precompiles won't be necessary. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there some kind of roadmap for the migration from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 in layman's terms? For true decentralization it is required to get more people on board that understand the full process. A: I described the three phases here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeueuzc EthHub also does a great job at simply describing the path https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/ [Danny Ryan] Q: ETH token will not be transferable back after migration to ETH2.0 What will be the token ticker for the ETH2.0 chain native token? A: ETH\u2014at least when Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. Fungibility is a key design goal. [Justin Drake] Q: Where does new client software take lists of peers with their ip addresses and ports? Is there is centralized server? A: This is an implementation detail. Some clients may have a hardcoded list of \"bootstrap node\" IPs and ports. [Justin Drake] **Q: Do you have any final plans in mind about the current ETH inflation? A: Nothing final. Ultimately the community will have to make a tradeoff between low inflation and high security. See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 . [Justin Drake] Q: What are the odds that a fully sharded chain including state transitions is feasible? A: Very high. No fundamental problems unsolved. The tricky part is getting everything to fit together cleanly. [Danny Ryan] Q: Can I use a raspberry Pi to stake when staking is possible? And what do I do with it in the mean time? A: Nimbus ( https://github.com/status-im/nimbus ) is targeting resource-constrained validators :) [Justin Drake] Q: What's your opinion of EOS (or TRON, STEEM) in terms of dapp platform? A: I tend to be critical of that class of systems. See https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html and https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html for reasons why. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Any updates as far as overall inflation rate per year or per milestone/HF? Any updates as far as TPS per year or per milestone/HF? A: See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 [Justin Drake] Q: Can I make a Zcash coin on ETH 2.0 for example with all or most of the advantages of Zcash? A: Yes, there are already a number of experiments in eth1.0 to demonstrate usage of ZKSNARKs for both privacy and scalability. Check out miximus for privacy and roll up for scalability (both by barry whitehat!). Usage of ZKSNARKs will be supported in eWASM state execution so I expect more privacy solutions akin to Zcash to continue to be built on eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: Why is ETH 2.0 Phase 0 even needed as a \"main\" chain, and need Bether transform from real ether (hence risk losing some value), instead of doing a testnet only, because after all this is what phase 0 is, based on TestnetBEther? A: ETH 2.0 needs a main chain as a single point of truth for all the shards. The reason we have phases 0, 1, 2 is to break things down conceptually, and in terms of incremental releases to limit risk. [Justin Drake] Q: What work is being done to make the research behind ETH 2.0 more geographically decentralized? Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? A: Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? Once the spec is more mature I expect the community to pick this up, somewhat similar to how Andreas's books get translated. English seems to be the a lingua franca for research and development. [Justin Drake] Q: After PoS, if a node gets hacked, can the hacker make the node to lose its stake by confirming false transactions? A: When your validator gets penalised it is automatically deregistered to prevent further damage. We have a mechanism called \"partial slashing\". The idea is that, if something goes wrong with your validator it only gets penalised a bit if not many other validators also mess up around that time. So in the optimistic case of a lone hack you should recover most of your funds with your withdrawal key (kept secure, e.g. in cold storage). [Justin Drake] Q: Will contracts be able to pay for gas in Eth 2.0? A: That will likely be unlocked with abstraction (which includes gas abstraction). [Justin Drake] Q: Assuming the number of network nodes remains the same and the network graduates to full PoS... what is your expected maximum theoretical transaction throughout? A: Rough ballpark figures. 1024 shards * 10 transactions per second per shard ~= 10k transactions per second. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the most updated timeline for rolling out PoS? Since Vitalik already said 'research is done', what are developers' incentives to push things forward? Are there any specific measures taken to ensure a smooth transition? A: I expect the beacon chain (the core PoS chain) to launch late 2019. Ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses. Having the Ethereum 2.0 chain finalise the Ethereum 1.0 chain will take more time. [Justin Drake] Q: Will it be possible with sharding to have shards with different rules and/or technology independent from the other shards/beacon chain, but still using the same base tech in terms of transacting and security? For example: private eth network run in a shard connected to main eth network from which it takes just security from validators. Private transaction with ZKsnarks shard(s). Encrypted data shards. Erc20 like coin launched on ETH 2.0, but with it's own rules and maybe own shards somehow controlled by the smart contract of that erc20. A: Every shard has the same data availability layer, and the option to use EVM2.0 as an execution engine. That's common base-layer infrastructure. At the application layer contracts can be powered by non-EVM2.0 execution engines (so-called alternative execution engines). There's also a huge L2 design around state channels, plasma, cross-shard communication, etc. So at the application layer I expect lots of non-homogeneity across shards, as well as a lots of homogeneity thanks to standardisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Today, running full nodes isn\u2019t that hard, but the resource requirements are slowly increasing. How much thinking is being devoted to the greater infrastructure requirements of Eth 2.0 and how they will impact node participation and decentralization? A: Ethereum 2.0 validation should be sustainable from a resource perspective: Bandwidth: fixed cost (thanks for fixes shard block sizes) Storage: if not fixed then sustainable (thanks to ideas such as storage maintenance fees). Note that storing shard blocks since genesis is not required. CPU, memory I/O: similar situation to Ethereum 1.0 (gas limit that can be voted up or down). [Justin Drake] Q: How ETH 2.0 differs from ETH, and why POS instead of POW. A: PoS enables goodies such as economic finality and sharding. It is also much cheaper (in terms of inflation cost for hodlers, as well as ecologically) than PoW. [Justin Drake] Part 2 Q: What do you feel is the biggest unsolved challenge left in Eth 2.0 research which must be addressed before Phase 1 or Phase 2 could be implemented in the future? A: I really honestly think that there are no unsolved research challenges at this point. It's mostly \"how do we make this thing more elegant and take up fewer lines of code and have fewer edge cases\" on the research side. [Vitalik] Better understanding the incentives and various actors that might arise in a stateless and highly abstracted execution model. There is really great work being led by both the EF eWASM team and the Consensys Quilt team to better understand the design space and active build prototypes to vet ideas. [Danny] Q: Previously, a release date of January 2020 for Phase 0 was informally articulated. Do you feel this date is realistic and achievable? A: Thanks for noting its informality. :) Launching early next year is my personal target, but there is a lot that needs to be done before then! We need: long-running test nets (however that is defined), formal verification of the deposit contract, and clients to be ready for prime time, but right now it looks like everything will come together in time. We also don't want to rush clients into developing buggy software just to be ready by an arbitrary date. If anything, I think BLS standardisation efforts are the most likely to slow us down. We (as a greater blockchain community) are trying very hard to have a standardised signature scheme for better interoperability between all the chains. There is a high degree of consensus on this already, but establishing a new standard is always a slow process. [Carl] The client teams are doing a great job and continuing to push the envelope. I expect exciting progress to be made in the coming months, but I also expect that the last mile might be long. Early 2020 is realistic and still the target. [Danny] Q: Are the researchers happy with the current state of the economics of Ethereum 2.0? A: I don't think it's productive for us to worry about the absolute numbers at this point; the network will launch, and either the rewards will prove sufficient or they won't. The other thing worth worrying about is centralization incentives, but that's difficult to work out \"in theory land\"; much of the result in practice has to do with how lazy people are. [Vitalik] Q: My biggest worry about ETH 2.0 is that it will kill composability. Won't most dapps end up trying to build on the same shard as say MakerDAO so they can use Dai? A: Composability between shards is definitely unchartered territory but there are reasons to be optimistic: The shards are designed for homogeneity (unlike, say, Polkadot or Cosmos) to facilitate cross-shard communication. There are design patterns which abstract away the boundaries between shards. For example, one could consider shards 0 and 1 as a combined data availability substrate for an execution engine which requires more bandwidth. These design patterns will be more easily exploitable in the context of programmable execution engines. The shards are designed to be friendly to \"fast optimistic finality\" thanks to shard attestations which are somewhat analogous to block confirmations in the context of Eth1. What this means that is, in practice, the shards may act as one logical blockchain thanks to quick probabilistic finality of individual shards. The UI layer is also an opportunity to abstract away the boundary between shards. [Justin] Q: When can we expect the Beacon Chain to be finalizing/checkpointing the Eth1.x chain? A: My best guess is early 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: Under the specs there is a \" block.eth1_data \" property; based on that I thought that somehow we were going to have an hybrid validation starting Jan 2020 (if all goes well) from both PoW and PoS. As stakers, what are we going to validate except the validators, staking rewards & penalties if all the traffic will still be on eth 1.0 and we're not taking part? A: In order for Eth2 to finalise Eth1, 2 things are needed, Eth2 must vote on Eth1 (as is implemented as you point out) and Eth1 must change its fork rule to follow the finalised blocks on Eth1. The latter requirement requires an Eth1 hardfork. It is therefore easier to just have validator finalise the things you mention for now and later on add in Eth1 finalisation. Additionally, it is safer to launch without Eth1 finalisation in case of a Eth2 black-swan event in the early days. [Carl] Q: Rebuttals to the criticism that Eth 2.0 is extremely complex? A: It got considerably simpler over the last year. If you do a word count on the spec, it seems to be considerably smaller than the yellow paper at this point. There's a lot of things in eth2 that are much simpler than eth1. But there's definitely lingering complexity and I deeply care about minimizing it. [Vitalik] While the research path has been somewhat tortuous and hard to follow, the end product is arguably simple and clean. Expect more educational material highlighting the simplicity of the current design. Phase 0 is about 1024 lines of code to specify (assuming SHA256 and BLS12-381 as primitives). I expect phases 1 and 2 to be 1024 lines of code combined (assuming WASM as primitive). That's just the phase 0 consensus (deposit contract, beacon chain state transition function, and beacon chain fork choice rule). [Justin] Q: Why are there so many teams building eth2.0 clients? I understand the point of client diversity but don't you think 6 clients seem to be pushing it? Supporting so many clients would also divide the resources in terms of funding. Which clients do you see as the geth and parity of eth2.0? A: A few notes on client diversity: There's more than 6 clients being developed\u2014it's closer to 8. I expect consolidation\u2014a bunch of clients may not survive 2020. I expect specialisation\u2014one can focus on the browser (e.g. Lodestar), resource-constrained devices (e.g. Nimbus), the enterprise (e.g. Artemis), prototyping (e.g. Trinity), etc. A minimum of two production-ready clients are necessary for launch. I expect the first-mover advantage to be strong. All the above have, to an extent, historically happened on Eth1. [Carl] We definitely don't want a duopoly! For me personally, the ideal would be to have no single client exceed 1/3 of the network, so any software bug in any single client would not stop the network. Though having no single client exceed 1/2 is ok too and gets us most of the same benefit (if a major client has a bug, having no finality for a while while things are being figured out may even be an improvement...) I expect a power law distribution, and it's definitely likely that some of the clients will not survive to see significant usage on mainnet. [Vitalik] My guess on why so many clients showed up to do the hard work is that eth2.0 is both exciting as a purely technical challenge as well as a chance to make a mark on Ethereum and the crypto space in general. I'm pleased that there are so many great teams doing the hard work, but recently, I've been more focused on finding contributors to do value-add work outside of the core client implementation. Formal verification, academic analysis of protocols, testing, light clients, web3 interfaces and developer tooling, validator clients with great UX that plug into any underlying node, etc, etc. [Danny] Q: Are the Ethereum 2.0 clients eventually going to replace the 1.0 counterparts? For example, will Prism ever get merged to Geth? A: I expect the Eth1 clients to live a long and prosperous life :) On Prism: \"Likely not. Other than the language (Go), Prysm and Geth have very little in common.\" [Justin] Q: what happens when I stake 32 eth, and get slashed once? now that my stake is below 32 eth do i get kicked out of the validator set? A: Validators get kicked out when they get slashed. There is another ejection mechanism if your balance goes below 16 ETH from accumulating (non-slashing) penalties. [Justin] You also lose some amount of ETH. The minimum being set to 1 ETH currently. There is an additional penalty related to the number of other slashable offenses that have occurred in the recent time period. If more validators have been slashed recently, you lose more ETH. The maximum penalty occurs if ~1/3 of validators have been slashed recently, at which point you lose all ETH. This highlights the importance of having a discorrelated validator setup from other nodes and potentially having some fault tolerance setup with yourself before you sign things. [Danny] Q: What are the non-slashing offences? A: There are micro-penalties for not voting to finalise the same blocks as other validators and the inactivity penalty (for offline validators) for when the chain is not finalising for an extended period of time. [Carl] We have a bunch of micro-penalties for not optimally crafting attestations and penalties for being offline (search for get_attestation_deltasand get_crosslink_deltas here ). [Justin] Q: i hear a lot of hype around staking rewards, but what are the penalties for getting slashed? does the network have different punishments for different misbehavior (offline vs. double-signing)? is the \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\" still correct? A: I think you are conflating two thigs here, slashing and the inactivity leak. Inactivity leak If your validator node goes offline for 18 days, and the beacon chain is not finalizing, then your balance will be reduced by \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\". Slashing If a validator behaves provably maliciously, then they are slashed by having their balance reduced. Assuming client software is written well, this should be basically impossible to happen to you. Minimum penalty is 1 ETH, but it goes up linearly in the number of people slashed at the same time as you. See here for more [Carl] Important to note that if you are offline, but the chain is still finalizing you only stand to lose approximately the same as you would have gained. The quick reduction in balance over a ~2 week period only occurs when not finalizing. Another reason to have a discorrelated setup from the rest of the network! [Danny] Q:What is currently the most exciting new research development in Ethereum 2.0? A: The execution engine abstraction in phase 2 is quite exciting, taking account abstraction to the next level. It allows for the consensus part of execution to be an ultra thin layer of abstraction on top of data availability. Assuming WASM as a black box, it may be on the order of 256 lines of code to specify. There's an initial proposal from Vitalik here . The idea is that even the notion of a \"transaction\" is an application-layer detail which can be specified as WASM code. Compare this to Eth1 which \"enshrines\" an opinionated notion of replay protection (nonces), signatures (ECDSA), contracts, accounts (vs UTXOs), gas, storage, etc. [Justin] I'm lately most excited about this . The OVM work by Karl Floersch and co is along similar lines and also very interesting. [Vitalik] Q: Theres been some debate over the necessity of ASICs in Eth 2.0. I understand theres an effort to spread the cost out among various communities, but I think many people feel this might just end up being an expensive science project where the rewards dont justify the costs and if you itemised Eth 2.0, it seems like it might be the most expensive part. Are there alternatives besides relying on just Randao/Randao + ASICs (VDF)? What are the ELI5 upsides + downsides of the alternatives? I appreciate that the researchers are a tackling a difficult problem with randomness for a blockchain. A: It's important to stress that the VDF mechanism's safety is not critical to the safety of the Eth2 consensus; if the VDF scheme gets broken or someone makes an ASIC fast enough to predict all the outputs, all that happens is that the percentage of validators they need to corrupt a single committee drops by a few percentage points (think, from ~50% to ~33-40% plus a lot of computing power). I actually think the main value of the VDF is that it provides global trustable secure randomness to applications that need it. [Vitalik] +1 on consensus-layer security and/or performance gains, and value-add at the application-layer. The other \"promise\" of VDFs is that they are a new cryptographic building block with the rather unique notion of time. They can used for proofs of space, proofs of replication, proofs of history, anti-frontrunning, expiring zk-proofs, and hopefully further applications which are hard to predict today. [Justin] Q: I'd like to know more about the data availability layer of Ethereum 2.0 - particularly the economic costs of long-term data storage. Part of my political platform includes integrating blockchain technology with government operations. For example, I'd like to see all of America's public records stored on a public, open source, sufficiently decentralized blockchain. Would it make sense to build something like this on top of Ethereum 2.0? Why or why not? A: Realistically you would want an incentivized data storage platform like Swarm, with hashes of the documents stored on the ethereum blockchain. But I'd recommend thinking harder and trying to figure out how to answer the deeper question \"how could we use blockchains as a tool to minimize opportunities for misbehavior in government?\" Places to start I can think of include: Things like https://opencerts.io/ for all government-issued records Using https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/ to do online votes, starting in low-security contexts (I think petitions would be a good place to start and underexplored) An internal-use stablecoin where only government agencies can hold balances but transactions are visible to and auditable by the public Some kind of zero-knowledge privacy-preserving sales tax collection thing Blockchain-based solutions for esoteric government things like spectrum auctions Get your country (I'm speaking generically to all readers here :D) to make an Estonian-style E-ID system that lets people make digital signatures that can be verified by anyone publicly. This is not technically a blockchain application, but it would be a tool useful in many blockchain applications [Vitalik] Q: I recall /u/bobthesponge once saying that almost his entire Net worth is in Ether (even his salary from the EF). Are there any other researchers on the research team that are as convinced of Ethereum's future, besides Vitalik and Justin of course? No need to call someone out. Just percentages, ie. \"Over 50% of the research team is heavily (over 30% of net worth) invested in Ether financially\", would be sufficient. A: Somewhat ingrained in our culture, the research team doesn't talk much about net worths. Having said that, the research team has a lot of fresh blood (e.g. Dankrad, Proto, Carl) which I don't expect to be crazy invested in ETH.[Justin] I am not an eth whale, but I get paid in eth and have high exposure. [Danny] The aforementioned Carl here, let's put it this way: financially, emotionally, and intellectually, I am heavily exposed to ETH. [Carl] Q: How many Eth2.0 client teams have to have a finished client for the Beacon chain to go live? A: I asked the same question a few days ago. At this moment, it is still an open question and will likely be until much loser to the time. Obviously having more clients is better, but that should be played off against the launch date. I am currently torn between 2 and 3. (Having > 2 would be great because otherwise there is a client guaranteed to have a majority of the validator-base.) At the end of the day, it will come down to who is ready and when. [Carl] Two at minimum, ideally three. [Justin] Q: I understand that about 10 million eth is expected to provide good enough security for the network. In a hypothetical scenario, what happens in the situation where a large organization manage to secure more than 50% of the total eth staked and use it to maliciously attack the network? As i understand, the side with less total eth staked will be slashed, so won't this malicious actor be able to effectively kill the network? A: If a large actor were to aquire a large enough stake to take over the network they would need to buy >2/3 of the total staking supply which would drive the price up, so it's not a cheap attack in the first place. Secondly, you are not slashed if you vote for a minority chain, only if you behave provably maliciously in the eyes of 2/3 of the validators. One of the beautiful things about PoS is that these attacks can be handled with grace. We, as a community, can go in and hard-fork out the malicious actors so they have no more voting power. The malicious actors just burnt a lot of money to temporally halt a network. In PoW, by contrast, if someone buys ASICS with 51% hash power, there is no way to remove them from the system. [Carl] Q:Do the client teams feel their implementations will be sufficiently robust enough, stable enough, and easy enough to use that normal nerds (like myself) can safely run their node software, stake 32 ETH on it, and not be slashed or lose ETH due to client bugs? My biggest concern is losing ETH while being a well intentioned actor. I've ran Geth, Parity, Trinity, and EthereumJ (Harmony) nodes for multiple years now and those clients have been around a lot longer than any of the ETH 2.0 clients have, but they still have issues, still have bugs, still sometimes crash. A: I hope so! One key component in the incentive design is that penalties (for going offline and for being slashed) are only high if many other validators go offline at the same time. So any bug that doesn't hit every node at the same time should only cost you a minimal amount. [Vitalik] Q:suppose ethereum reaches 1 mllion tps, ledger size will grow 1 terabyte everyday, any solution to this? what is your projections in terms of ledger size growh and what is your solution to this A: The sharded eth2.0 is expected to handle ~10MB/s of data availability. This is data that is come to consensus upon in shard chains and guaranteed to be available in at least the ~2 week time frame. This is not necessarily state size. The current approach to state and state execution is to take a \"state-less\" approach in which blocks must contain the merkle witnesses of the relevant state to perform the tx executions. This is reduces the amount of state any consensus node must store, but does bring up other issues about state size, who stores it, how users get it, etc. In fact, the entirety of state execution is being abstracted away such that we can experiment with multiple schemes to deal with this problem (state rent, users/dapps storing their own data, etc). Much of the state rent research that @ledgerwatch has driven in the past year or so will likely come into play. [Danny] Q: Lets assume you are a guy with very little cryptotech-knowledge, but you do have >32 ETHER. Question #1: Would staking be made easy-to-do, so \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? Question #2: Does staking pose any risks of losing ETH by accident? Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network (eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise) A: Would staking be made easy-to-do, s\u00e5 \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? I expect a cottage industry will be setup around accessibility. Infrastructure to be built includes staking pools (centralised\u2014think Coinbase\u2014as well as decentralised one) as well as plug-and-play \"validator in a box\" solutions. Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network That's definitely the goal. eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise Penalties should be marginal for validator nodes that go offline for short periods of time every once in a while. [Justin] Q: What is the current thinking around the Eth1>Eth2 migration plan? A: The current approach is to fold eth1 into eth2 as an execution environment. In practice, this will mean that we would need to have a hard fork on the eth1 side to rebalance some gas costs (opcodes that read storage or read accounts would see their gas costs increased to 2000-10000), and after that at some point there will be a \"flag block height\" from which the eth1 state root will be moved into the eth2 system (or possibly some one-time processing will be run on the eth1 state to make some optimizations, eg. replacing the patricia hex trie with a binary tree) and after that eth1 will be part of eth2, with applications being able to run as before. I do think the likely gas cost increase of storage/account reading opcodes (basically the same opcodes whose gas costs were already increased in Tangerine Whistle; those costs will need to go up at least another order of magnitude) is something that contract devs should be aware and plan for. The reason that change will be necessary is that those opcodes greatly increase the size of a Merkle proof needed to statelessly verify a block, so currently Merkle proofs for a worst-case block are >100 MB; with those gas repricings plus trie optimization plus charging per byte of any contract being read, we could get it down to acceptable levels. [Vitalik] Q: Regarding Proof-of-Stake and wealth distribution (and issuance reduction), by the looks of it the majority of ETH will be held by the minority of entities, does that cause any concern since a single entity can run multiple validator nodes (and earn more rewards)? It's a question from inequality perspective not security; if ETH were to take a significant role in the global economy, wouldn't this widen the gap between rich and poor by orders of magnitude (MUCH worse than the current economic system)? Basically, economic inequality on steroids. A: I definitely think income inequality issues from crypto are an issue! It's a big part of why I am not a single-cryptocurrency maximalist. But I still think that PoW is not better than PoS from an inequality point of view, because although PoW does distribute coins into \"fresh hands\", you need so much capital to become a PoW miner that PoW itself is a big rich-get-richer mechanic in practice. [Vitalik] Q: I know its still early but are there some rough estimates of when we might see Spec freezes for Phase 1 and 2? A: Phase 2 is a bit too far out to say, but my hope for phase 1 is Q3/4 of this year. [Carl] That said, the current minimal execution design with EEs for phase 2 (once better researched and prototyped) is a super simple addition on top of phase 1 [Danny] Q: Please ELI5 (\"explain like I'm five\") why the need for a second chain instead keeping on evolving the first one? A: Building Eth2 on Eth1 would be a bad design decision for a few reasons: We would be constrained by the Eth1 gas limit, which would severely affect performance (e.g. 1024 shards and 32 ETH to validate would not be possible). We would be mixing the consensus and application layers. This means the consensus layer is subject to the application-layer DoS vectors (e.g. high gas prices). It would also mean \"enshrining\" application-layer contracts, which is far from ideal from a governance standpoint which should be as neutral as possible with regards to deployed contracts (i.e. The DAO interventions should be the exception, not the norm). We would be constrained by the EVM, which is notoriously hard to safely program complex contracts in. Eth1 does not have support for BLS12-381. We would be subject to the Eth1 block time Poisson distribution (as opposed to the regular\u2014and shorter\u2014slots durations in Eth2). The list goes on :) [Justin] Q: I am considering to stake during phase 0, but i am a bit concerned about the inactivity leak. I want to know how to stop/pause being a validator if I change my mind? I am asking this as there may be certain situations in which I think I will be offline for a while, and I do not want my balance to slowly leak out due to that. A: You will only suffer large penalties if you are offline at the same time that >1/3 of other validators are offline. Otherwise the penalties for being offline will be tiny, to the point where you will be net-profitable (not including computer costs etc) as long as you are online more than ~50-67% of the time. The incentives are deliberately designed to be forgiving to avoid discouraging amateur setups to promote decentralization. [Vitalik] The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Q: 1024 shards, 131,000+ validator slots... what happens if there aren't enough validator slots filled by the time sharding goes live? A: With 1024 shards, and 128 validators in a committee, a minimum of 131,072 validators are needed to crosslink every shard every slot. If there are fewer validators than this, then shards are skipped to ensure the 128/committee validator number. [Carl] The system can naturally handle as low as ~64 validators. In this case, security is obviously insanely degraded, but the protocol can technically move forward. [Danny] Technically the system can \"move forward\" with one validator :D But yes, below the 131,072 validator (4.1M ETH) level the properties of the system progressively degrade as the number of validators goes lower and lower. [Vitalik] Q: if i understand finalization correctly, the more validators you have the longer it takes to finalize. how is eth2 addressing this issue without pounding the network with tons of messages being sent between all the validators? A: Correct. I wrote an article about this fundamental tradeoff here: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735 We managed to get a couple orders of magnitude more favorable tradeoff curve than other projects through BLS signature aggregation, which reduces the marginal cost of a signature to 1 bit of data and 1 ECADD (~0.001 traditional signature verifications) of computation. [Vitalik] In Eth2, more validators should not lead to (significantly) longer finalization times. By making use of BLS signature aggregation and by grouping the validators into committees, we're able to support hundreds of thousands (and hopefully into the millions) of validators. [Carl] Q: Has the EF given any thought to maybe issuing \"official\" NFTs (i.e. collectibles) to initial stakers upon the launch of Beacon Chain as an \"extra incentive\"? What's your opinion on this? I'd say this would be the remit of the community, not the EF. Note that the Eth2 designers avoided giving early validators a special reward (e.g. giving the first 16,384 validators a 1 ETH bounty) to avoid distorting the economic experiment. We want to learn whether or not the basic incentivises are sufficient to incentivise participation. [Justin] I actually like the idea of an NFT. The deposit contract is readable in such a way that proofs can be made to a separate contract to generate NFTs. Been talking to Austin Griffith about this. He/burner-wallet might take the charge. I don't think an NFT would hinder our ability to understand the pure incentivizes here. It's at best a trophy and of little economic value imo. [Danny] Q: How is the work on evaluating the feasibility of producing dedicated VDF hardware coming along? A: At this point there's reasonably high confidence that VDFs (including building hardware) are viable. A few updates: A team of 3 ex-Intel people (Simon, Sean, Kelly from Supranational) is dedicated to the hardware aspects. The Rivest timelock challenge (open for 20 years, designed to last 35 years) was cracked in a few months using an FPGA (see here, and here). There's also code on Github. Work by Erdinc Ozturk has improved the state-of-the-art circuit depth for the modular exponentiation in VDFs. The ePrint paper was submitted a few days ago and should be published soon. A prominent complexity theorist (Ryan Williams from MIT) is working on circuit depth lower bounds for modular multiplication. Significant progress was made by Ligero on the RSA ceremony. We are planning for a ceremony with unprecedented scale (1024 participants) in 2020. New research papers keep flowing in\u2014see http://vdfresearch.org The $100K FPGA competition is starting in a few weeks. We have relevant corporate sponsors for the FPGA and ASIC competitions. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation and Protocol Labs (i.e. Filecoin), a new blockchain project (to be announced with the FPGA competition) is helping with funding. $900K was raised in the latest round of funding. [Justin] Q: Is there a chance for obligatory anonymity of future validator withdrawals? Force every withdrawal to go to a shielded pool - like zcash does with mining rewards. I fear without the obligatory anonymity here just using a mixer/etc is going to be treated as extremely suspicious - forcing stakers would add plausible deniability. A: I definitely support moving toward more and more privacy being a default over time! I'd say validator deposits are more important to mix than withdrawals, as that way it becomes harder to locate the nodes of specific validators which seems like it would increase security and censorship resistance. [Vitalik] Q: What are the main incentives to run a beacon node for validators if they can just connect to high-up time beacon nodes?If there are beacon node providers with high up-time - how is this going to be decentralized? A: There is an anti-centralisation incentive mechanism baked in. Basically, validators get punished for going offline the more other validators are offline at the same time. So \"uncorrelated downtime\" should be optimised in addition to \"high uptime\". [Justin] Q: If, as a validator, I know that I'm going to be offline for a period of time, is is possible to 'pause' validating without suffering an inactivity leak? A: The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Clarification: there's a minimum ~1 day period before you can withdraw after you exit. It's safe to be offline during that time, but it does prevent you from re-entering. If we want to, in some future version we could add a \"re-enter\" feature that allows immediate re-depositing without waiting to withdraw first.... there's no theoretical reason why such a thing would not be possible. [Vitalik] Q: Do we have clarity yet on whether currently locked-down smart contracts (eg metronomes 4 contracts by Jeff garzik) will continue to work seamless in ETH2.0 or whether these contracts will be deprecated with all ETH in them lost? And how can storage costs be added to locked-down contracts in ETH 1.x ? In other words can we all assume immutable contracts on ETH1.0 will continue to work forever (provided enough people want them to)? Thx A: The current plan is that eth1 will be folded into eth2 as an execution environment via the stateless client approach, in which case, yes, contracts will keep working as expected. [Vitalik] Q: According to this paper, it may be possible for Quantum Computers to hijack and re-sign transactions DURING BLOCKTIME by (as early as) 2027. In other words, ownership of ANY wallet that has not upgraded to a quantum secure signature scheme BEFORE THEN can no longer be trusted AT ALL (even WITHOUT previous outgoing transactions). SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: Is anyone who fails to manually upgrade their wallets before a deadline (in order to become quantum secure) guaranteed to lose their funds after the advent of Quantum Computers? For example, if someone stores a PAPER WALLET for let's say 20 years, are they going to lose their funds by that time? Can QCs just monitor the entire blockchain and automatically attempt to hijack any transaction with insecure signature scheme during one blocktime, even if the sender has no previous outgoing transactions? A: Even if a quantum computer gets announced as immediately usable tomorrow, it is possible to do an emergency procedure to secure the funds of everyone who has not yet publicly released their public key or a signature (ie. every standard account holder that has not signed a transaction). You do this by doing a soft fork to disallow standard transactions, and replace them with a special transaction type that uses a STARK to prove that you own the private key k such that the given address A equals to hash(G * k)[12:] , and then moves the funds over into a new address type that uses a quantum-secure signature scheme, eg. Winternitz signatures. If we get more warning, then we can get people to update to Winternitz on an orderly schedule. TLDR: we're fine. [Vitalik] Q: how do/will the performance bottlenecks compare between 1.x and 2.0 A: 2.0 removes the disk I/O bottleneck for consensus participants by heavily leaning towards stateless clients. Finality greatly mitigates the sync latency bottleneck, and the requirement for consensus participants to store historical blocks. [Justin] I'd also add that I expect light clients to be massively more viable in eth2 than in eth1. About the same order of magnitude load as a bitcoin light client to stay synced (as opposed to eth1, where light clients are not light enough in practice to run on phones...) [Vitalik] Q: As an ETH miner, my main concern is how to prep for ETH 2.0. Any wiki, tips, or advice on how to proceed contributing (and profiting) for Ethereum? A: Eth2 has no mining. You may be able to put those GPUs to good use at the application layer with protocols like Golem, or maybe protocols that incentivise GPU-accelerated SNARK proofs. [Justin] Q: Approximately when is ETH issuance supposed to drop dramatically? (I believe the figure I've come accross is 10x reduction in issuance, is this correct also?) A: When the PoW chain starts piggybacking on the PoS chain for security (this could happen during phase 1 or phase 2), it becomes safe to lower the PoW chain reward by maybe ~4x. Further reductions would happen when the PoW chain stops entirely. [Vitalik] Q: During Phase 0, will ETH 2.0 be transferrable between wallets? 2.0 to 2.0? If so, are there concerns exchanges will list ETH 2.0? A: Transfers will probably only go live in Phase 1 at which point exchanges will list ETH2.0. Having exchanges to so will help maintain price-parity between ETH and ETH2.0. [Carl] Q: if block reward is X eth, and it is enough to secure the block, why do we pay X+gas to miners? Will this change? A: In Eth2 the economic security is not a direct function of the block rewards. Instead, it is a function of the total amount at stake. Will this change? Eth2 should have a partial fee burning mechanism (see EIP1559). [Justin] Q: As ETH 2.0 currently stands what are the odds of a uni-directional vs bi-directional 1.x to 2.0 bridge? A: The uni-directional Eth1 -> Eth2 bridge comes with the beacon chain. I'd say it's likely there will be a bi-directional bridge eventually (though unlikely to happen in 2020). Even better than a bi-directional bridge (based on light clients, which comes with non-negligible latency) is native integration of Eth1 into Eth2 (see here). [Justin] Q: Will the issuance rate be enough to incentivize validators given the competition from say DeFi products and will it be changed in the future if needed? A: Compound rates for ETH are ~0.02% AFAIK, so very easy to compete with. The \"do you take 3% interest staking or 6% lending DAI on Compound\" framing is highly misleading, because that 6% is on USD, which is very different to having 3% on ETH. But over time I do expect interest rates on ETH to slide up as more forms of staking become available (eg. channels, Plasma, Truebit, other security deposit games...). [Vitalik] Q: What are the research team's thoughts / plans on if there is extreme price differences between ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0? I would think arbitrage would solve the issue but haven't thought too deeply on the subject myself. In paticular, if ETH 1.0 coins are worth significantly more causing people to not want to redeem their ETH 2.0 coins because they will instantly take a price hit versus just selling. A: I'm not too worried: Transfers and exchanges can be used to redeploy \"cheap\" Eth2 coins for validation. Large holders (e.g. the EF) can be arbitragers. The greater the price delta, the greater the incentive to deliver a two-way bridge ASAP. [Justin] Q: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? If no, is there any other mechanism to prevent adversaries that can corrupt a shard quickly from applying an invalid state transition? A: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yep! If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Looks like ~10x data (though very low computation, and we expect data to be cheaper than computation). But with techniques like https://ethresear.ch/t/layer-2-state-schemes/5691, even that could potentially be unnecessary. [Vitalik] Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yes. are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Now that execution engines are application layer, the answer is technically 0 :) For execution engines that use large Merkle trees (e.g. Eth1) the rough estimate at one point was 8x. I'm personally excited for execution engines that do Merkle path \"witness compression\" using SNARKs (proof creation accelerated by GPUs, FPGAs, or even ASICs). [Justin] Q: What is the current design to move Ether tokens on eth1 to eth2? A: That depends on what you mean by \"Ether tokens\". Validators can send a deposit of 32 ETH to the deposit contract which is then transferred to the beacon chain where they can begin validation. For people who wish to transfer their ETH from Eth1->2, that is not something that has been decided upon yet, but there will (probably) exist a dedicated bridge for this purpose (otherwise they can go through the deposit contract). It is still too early to know about ERC20/721 tokens. If Eth2 has an Eth1 execution engine, then it could be pretty painless, but even if not, an ERC20 token could just be transferred by copying over its state root. [Carl] Q: Sorry in advance if my questions are dumb but I didn't follow closely Ethereum 2.0 for couple months. Is there an approximative release date? Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? A: Is there an approximative release date? January 3, 2020 at the earliest for phase 0. I'd say Q1 2020 is likely. Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? 32 ETH. Rewards depend on the total number of validators, individual validator performance, and the gas markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the typical validator has an annual return around 10%. What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? I'm proud to have been able to make a contribution in a beautiful piece of infrastructure I believe will radically change the world in a positive way :) Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? No. [Justin] Q: When sharding is released, will there just suddenly be 1024 shards in existence, or will there be a small but growing number of shards as usage goes up? Starting with such a high number will leave a lot of unused space/capacity A: All 1024 shards will be launched at once. Growing the number of shards is (probably) unneeded complexity. Shards with lots of unused capacity will have lower gas prices attracting more users. Q: How can the average person help with eth2.0? Donations? Documentation? Are there any organized efforts underway? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: After the scaling issues are solved will this be an economical platform to host backend logic on? How will this compare to running your own server or going through a cloud hosting company in terms of cost and ease of use for light or heavy workloads? Personally, my highest anticipated use case is hosting multiplayer matchmaking and signaling, though I haven\u2019t built such a system yet out of concern for difficulty and cost. A: It's unlikely that Eth2 on its will be used as a backend for heavy workloads, the data throughput is likely just too high. That said, it works really well as a dispute resolution layer so a centralised service can run the backend optimistically and if someone disagrees with the execution, they can contest and have it resolved on Eth2. For lighter use-cases it probably can, but this is more in the context of a dapp. [Carl] Q: I was under the assumption that ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain, no need to swap coins or anything but will this transition from ETH1 to ETH2 cause a fork in the community similar to ETC Ethereum classic and ETH chain? Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? A: ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Eth2 is such a big upgrade over Eth1 that it is easier to implement as an entirely new chain than to upgrade. See Justin's ELI5 here for more . Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? The large majority of it, yes. Rewards are also issued on the Eth2 chain so that increases the supply there too. Ultimately, the expectation is that all Eth1 ETH will be transferred to Eth2. Q: Do you think its worth laying 6 month/1 year/2 year 'ground rules' for Eth 2.0 chain assuming something unexpectedly goes wrong? A: My concern with doing something like this is its inflexibility. It is basically impossible to cover all the possible cases and even if we could, I'd argue that such an approach is too inflexible to handle the intricacies of exactly how something has failed. Handling it on a case-by-case basis seems like a better solution to me. [Carl] Q: Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? For example like proposed with Casper, every 100th block will be validated by PoS. A: The integration between Eth1 and Eth2 is a roadmap orthogonal to phases 1, 2, 3 of Eth2. Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? My best guess is this will happen in 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: What happens if you send more ETH to the deposit contract? Like 32.1 or 40? A: Nothing is stopping you from sending >32 Eth to the deposit contract, but you'll only receive rewards on the first 32 Eth, so it's not something I'd really recommend. [Carl] That's fine. Your balance will reflect the deposit, and the balance in excess of 32 ETH can be transferred to another validator (phase 1) or to a shard (phase 2). [Justin] Q: What's the easiest set up to stake let's say 320 ETH? A: A laptop should be capable of handling around 10 validators so you should be able to send 10*32 Eth to the deposit contract and start validating on your 1 machine. [Carl] A laptop should be sufficient. We'll know more in a few months when the numbers for block sizes and gas limits of shard blocks get finalized. [Vitalik] Q: What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I read you're involved in discussions with them, have you helped each other in developing code? A: I read you're involved in discussions with them I've had brief VDF discussions with Harmony. have you helped each other in developing code? Don't think so, at least not yet. What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I had a brief look at their whitepaper which seems to be inspired by Ethereum. So I guess my opinion is that their approach to scalability is great :) [Justin] Q: If Eth 2.0 introduces PoS, are there legal hurdles to be clarified upon? Could the token be considered a security token? A: I'm not aware of any jurisdiction that considers ETH on Eth1 a security, and since ETH on Eth2 is basically the same as ETH on Eth1 (other than the temporary technicality of two separate tokens) then ETH on Eth2 should not be a security. [Justin] Q: I'm planning to run a beacon node + N validators. Do you think this will will be able to be managed by a Raspberry Pi 4? I'm aware that it is being worked out to have ARM64 binaries ready soon, the question is if it seems realistic not to have a computer running at home and instead running something smaller and cleaner environmentally speaking like a Pi4. A: That depends on \"N\". I (personally) fully expect a RPi3 to be able to run at least one validator node, but we'll only know this when clients are closer to delivery. [Carl] Q: What are some smaller things that you guys would like an average r/ethtrader community member could help with? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: Is there any clarity on the transition process regarding basic aspects like whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example, and whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? Better asked, how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? A: whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example Beacon eth will be sellable on exchanges when transfers are enabled in phase 1. whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? That will come later, see here . how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? The long term plan is to natively integrate Eth1 into Eth2. See here . [Justin] Q: Can you explain somewhat precisely how cross sharding communication would work. As in how does shard node A talk to shard node B without going through some sort of intermediary? If they can do this talking, why can't it be used for eth to talk to say bitcoin. A: The intermediary is the beacon chain, or infrastructure optimistically predicting what will eventually get finalised in the beacon chain. [Justin] Q: How would you objectively judge the level of technological advancement of current eth and current bitcoin as far as the very limited function of sending coins from A to B is concerned? A: Eth1 and Bitcoin are comparable for on-chain payments. [Justin] Q: Presuming you agree price drives security, and presuming you agree all cryptos reside in a very competitive environment, are there any plans to address the increased issuance that the Beacon chain would bring? In addition, are there any plans to meet or maybe even surpass bitcoin's coded reduction of new supply to 2% next year. And related, what would you say to the criticisms that have already been expressed whereby if you can reduce issuance by say 10x, you can increase it too. Or asked in a more open question manner, what do you think of this process through which increases or decreases of issuance are made? A: It's possible Eth2 will cause net-negative issuance. The reason is that ETH gets burned via transaction fees. Pushing code to the beacon chain will also burn ETH. Finality, the penalties also burns ETH. [Justin] Q: Will phase 0 contain any scalability improvements? How many transactions per second will Ethereum be able to handle with Sharding? A: Phase 0 will allow for a light client that can give you hashes of the eth1 chain in a fairly lightweight way (but not too lightweight, you'll need ~200kb per 6 minutes to keep up with the committees, this will go down to 200kb per a few days with phase 1). This could be used to allow eg. light clients inside of browsers to work efficiently. That's a kind of scalability improvement, and an underdiscussed one imo. [Vitalik] Phase 0's purpose is tracking validators' states and producing randomness, asking about its scalability is not really meaningful. Regarding Tx/s, the answer is not really known. As a basic calculation, if each shard has the same throughput as Eth1.x, then we'll have 16 * 1024 = 16,384 Tx/s (assuming no inter-shard Txs). That said, the above numbers are kinda meaningless as Eth2 is designed to be used along with L2 scaling solutions like Rollups and OVM which could yield insanely high throughputs. [Carl] Q: Can you address points 2 - 4 in this tweet ? A: The default idea for clocks in eth2 is https://ethresear.ch/t/network-adjusted-timestamps/4187. There has not been that much work done on writing \"policeman\" software that would detect slashable violations by validators and penalize them, but I am not worried about this. Reasons: Even if no one writes the code, that just means the security model degrades to honest majority, which is not the worst One client implementing the code correctly is sufficient If a client implements the code badly, there's no consensus risk, they could just ship with badly written code that only works half the time and it would catch half the slashable violations. I'll defer to Danny on wire protocol stuff. [Vitalik] Point 2: \"Wire protocol\" => This is an implementation detail that I'm sure the implementers will agree upon soon enough :) The high-level recommendation from the research team is to use libp2p as the networking stack (dicv5 for discovery) and SSZ for serialisation. But this cannot enforced at the consensus layer, and we've already seen alternatives (e.g. clients using Whiteblock for networking, and Prysm is using protobufs in some places). Point 3: \"Clients to slash surround votes\" => Not sure what this means. The spec clearly defines the slashing mechanism for surround votes. See is_slashable_attestation_data. Point 4: \"Decentralized network time protocol\" => Just like Eth1, clocking is an implementation detail. It is to an extent decentralised (e.g. there are alternatives to NTP such as GPS, one can choose his/her NTP servers, one can use local clocks, etc.). It would be nice to have something even more robust but this is research territory\u2014not required for launch of Eth2. [Justin] Q: Why aren't Beacon nodes rewarded? Wouldn't this allow the network to be more decentralized? A: Validators are rewarded. Beacon nodes that are not validators are not rewarded in protocol because the protocol can't tell who's a beacon node vs just pretending to be one (eg. via 100 fake nodes pointing to the same real node). Though non-validator nodes may be able to earn money in eth2 through incentivized light client protocols. Q: In regards to the recent proposal of vitalik to use the bcash chain as a short-term scaling solution until eth 2.0 launches: is eth 2.0 still on track? is there a concrete demand for an interim solution? A: The main motivation for proposing an interim solution (if you don't like bitcoin cash for political reasons, I also recommended ethereum classic, I think it's also a good choice) is to make it easier for the work on building these layer 2s to be able to get off the ground in parallel with finalizing the work on the eth2 layer 1 itself. In general, the ethereum community is large, so doing things in parallel is its advantage. [Vitalik] Q: You do not plan to work on the creation of parachain (eth 2.0.) On Polkadot? I don't think EF will have to drive this. Web3/Parity are on it and I believe consider it to be a top priority. The Shasper (Parity) client is written in substrate to help facilitate this happening. [Danny] Q: Pretty basic but what's a realistic estimate of throughput after every is put together? A: Somewhere between 5000 and 500000 TPS depending on what execution environment and transaction type you're using. [Vitalik] Q: Could you say anything about the adoption of Ethereum Blockchain? Are there plans to create something like a B2B team actively approaching \"qualified\" companys? A: I'd say the Ethereum Foundation's primary focus is the consensus layer (research, development, education, maintenance, etc.), more so than the application layer. [Justin] Data Questions with Justin Drake Q: How much data will there be in Eth2? JD: As the spec currently stands, on average 2.8MB/s across all shards with a \"burst mode\" which is 4x that (i.e. 11.3MB/s). Q: What does this translate into for state size? JD: At the consensus layer block size and state size are basically orthogonal considerations. Consensus-layer state size will always remain very small since we lean heavily on stateless clients. In theory application-layer state (\"L2 state\") can grow up to 2.8MB/s. For execution engines without state rent, you can expect state to grow roughly as fast as Eth1 state grows today. Multiply that by 1024 shards and the situation is possibly not long-term sustainable. This is a significant reason why I personally believe we should progressively launch execution engines (as opposed to allowing anyone to deploy EEs at launch), starting with an EE that has state rent. Q: What role do nodes play (versus validators)? JD: At the consensus layer non-validator nodes don't play any role. At the networking layer they can act as lubricants to relay message. They may also help create blocks for block proposers, i.e. be \"relayers\". Q: Who will run these nodes? JD: Nodes can be run by anyone who wants \"direct\" access to Eth2 (e.g. service providers such as exchanges, etherscan, power users). Relayer nodes may be run by specialised businesses. Q:For someone that needs to run a node (EtherScan), what will the resourcing look like? JD: They will get their data by being nodes and listening on the gossip networks. The bad news is that bandwidth should grow by roughly 1024x to keep track of all shards. But then again, that's not terrible news because a good internet connection (especially server-class) can handle 4 11.2MB/s (the 4 is, say, the gossiping overhead). The good news is that consensus state is minimal (again, stateless clients), which means zero consensus-layer I/O which is currently an Eth1 bottleneck. They can then choose withever EEs and/or dApps it wants to support, i.e. it's opt-in. Q:How do we assume all data is stored and available? JD: For recent blocks we have quite sophisticated infrastructure, including proofs of custody in phase 1 and data availability proofs (possibly phase 2). For historical blocks we rely on the ecosystem to keep them around. Q:What will \"historical blocks\" be needed for. As in, if they were lost forever, what would be messed up? JD: Historical blocks are required to recompute application-layer state, and may also contain application-layer receipts. If they were lost forever (which I don't expect would ever happen) then applications without at least one synced full node may lose user state. Q:Will people congregate on a few shards? JD: Hard to tell. Naive dApp design would suggest that dApps would aggregate into clusters within shard boundaries. We are exploring dApp designs that are somewhat shard-agnostic, i.e. consume data availability from shards as a fungible resource. Q:Quick explanation of cross shard communication and where research is? JD: Cross shard communication is a huge design space, just like \"plasma\" or \"state channels\". At the consensus layer we don't provide much infrastructure beyond crosslinks. I'm expecting significant experimentation in the early days followed by standardisation, somewhat similar to the token transfer design space and the ERC20 standard. One big idea is the concept of \"optimistic crosslink\" which are shared between shards in advance of the real crosslinks, and which with high probability will match the actual crosslinks that get finalised. dApps can use optimistic crosslinks to get super-low cross-shard latency. Q:Why 1024 shards? JD: Because 2048 shards would be stressing the beacon chain and 512 shards would be under-utilising the beacon chain.

A: In phase 1 (about 2020 by my estimate) we will have shard data. Those shards, even without an EVM, can be used as the data availability layer for TrueBit (and other alternative execution engines). Phase 2 (about 2021) is when we will have scalable L1 execution. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: ELI5 execution engines Follow up A: An execution engine is a way to compute state assuming consensus on data. The execution engine for the EVM is \"naive re-execution\". There are more fancy execution engines such as TrueBit and SNARK/STARK-based validity proofs. [Justin Drake] Q: Are economists being consulted to help decide the issuance rate of a full POS system? Stated more broadly, who is helping/advising the ETH 2.0 team on the effects certain issuance decisions will have on the network and community (both in the short and long term)? A: Personally at this point the feedback I'm most interested in is actually feedback from potential stakers. The main question basically being, are there any other tweaks we can make to the economics that, given a fixed level of reward, will (i) encourage more people to validate, and (ii) encourage many small solo validators or smaller pools, as opposed to a few large pools. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Considering that Yoichi is not working anymore in the Foundation, what are your plans on formal verification of ETH 2.0 specs? A: I'd say that formal verification of the spec will make sense when the spec is more mature and stable, maybe mid 2019. Anyone interested in doing formal verification of the ETH 2.0 specs in a few months, please send a grant proposal. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the best response to a developer who is hesitant about building on ethereum today, given that it will be \"replaced\" by ETH 2.0 over the next few years? A: I expect that once the state and execution model for Serenity solidifies (see https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 for one minimal proposal) we'll start working with the developer community on modifications to high-level languages (Solidity, Vyper, etc) and best practices. Hopefully at that point it will become clearer how to build applications in such a way that they could be redeployed as-is on the 2.0 chain. At least that's my hope. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Building on Ethereum 1.0 today is great for learning and prototyping. It's also great for assembling a culturally-aligned team consistent with the philosophy of the Ethereum community (which may be different than the philosophy of the Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Tether, etc. communities). [Justin Drake] Q: Can we run multiple validator clients on a single machine assuming we've got multiple 32 Eth deposits? A: Yep! There's nothing preventing you from using one machine to run multiple validators. The only hard limit you'll face is that the number of shards you are assigned to validate increases linearly with the number of validator slots you have, so if you have thousands of ETH a laptop will not suffice and you'll need something more powerful. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Short answer: Yes. Long answer: You will need to register a validator for every 32 ETH. In phase 0 (just the beacon chain, no shards) you can likely handle thousands of validators on a single machine. After phase 1 the number of validators that can be operated on a single machine depends on how resourceful your machine is. A mainstream laptop should comfortably handle one validator, and likely handle 2-10 validators at max capacity. The computational resources scales linearly with the number of validators until you reach ~1,000 validators. At that point there are scalability advantages in being a super-node, i.e. a full node for every shard. [Justin Drake] Follow up Q: How much importance are the devs placing on being able to run setups at home wrt keeping Ethereum decentralised and being able to move ETH in and out of staking pools? Follow up A: It's definitely a goal I care about. The alternative to staking at home is staking on AWS or staking through a pool, and both are risks for decentralization. Concrete ways we try to be friendly to staking at home: Relatively forgiving penalties for being offline, so you earn a net profit as long as you're online more than ~50-67% of the time Keeping the cost of validating the beacon chain low The anti-correlation penalty scheme, which more heavily penalizes validators that misbehave at the same time as many other validators (which is more likely if you're on the same pool or VPS or whatever). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: How can I help / get involved? I fell in love with Ethereum not too long ago. I\u2019ve been reading Zcash\u2019s BLS12-381 Elliptic Curves and for the past few days these are all thats been on my mind. I love this project now and just found ethresear.ch. I really wanna help in any way possible! Thanks again for all your hard work. I can\u2019t stop reading these posts. A: For researchers a good way to contribute and gain visibility is to post quality content on ethresear.ch. If you are a developer consider joining one of the numerous ETH2.0 implementation teams. [Justin Drake] A2: Hi! The best way to get involved is to find something that captures your interest and to dig in. Because Ethereum is a radically open platform, the research and development is also generally very open and very accessible. Keep reading. Follow your interests down all the little paths and begin to build a mental model of the ecosystem. https://ethresear.ch/ is a great place to follow and begin to contribute to research discussions. https://gitter.im/ethereum/sharding is where a lot of the day to day conversation about Serenity is happening (developers chatting from various projects) https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs Read the spec! but not only read it, be an active reader. If you find an error, typo, bug, etc, submit a PR. Also check out the issues and PRs in the spec repo. We are constantly discussing changes, fixes, updates and anyone can contribute. If you are a dev, open up one of the eth2.0 client projects and pick a \"good first issue\". These allow you to touch the codebase, contribute a bit, get the lay of the land, and provide the foundation to tackle bigger issues from there. ^ Those are Serenity specific suggestions, but beyond that, just find projects you are interested in and begin contributing. There is so much to do and project leads are always excited to have helping hands. This stuff doesn't build itself :) [Danny Ryan] A3: If you're interested in Cryptography especially, you can also check out another BLS - Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham signature spec for Serenity and help to review it: https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/bls_signature.md :) For research, as Justin and Danny said, ethresear.ch is the sanctuary. And first, you can take a look the various topics on Ethereum Sharding Research Compendium to see which area you're most interested in. For implementation, there are multiple topics: Consensus layer - implement the spec! P2P layer design and implementation - see https://github.com/ethresearch/p2p [Hsiao-Wei Wang] Q: From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside. Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)? For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse. A: Cross-shard communication will definitely be slow at base layer, however there are higher-level mechanisms that can be used to implement fast cross-shard communication on top of a base layer that allows any cross-shard communication at all even if slow. See https://ethresear.ch/t/a-layer-2-computing-model-using-optimistic-state-roots/4481 for an example of how this could be done. In general, I expect a lot of the long-run innovation in improving the smart contract development experience to happen at higher levels in this way; I write about why this is a good idea at length here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/08/26/layer_1.html [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What happens to all the contracts currently running? A: It is somewhat speculative at this point. My best guess is that Ethereum 1.0 contracts will stay running as-is for a long time (say, 10+ years) without any migration to Ethereum 2.0. This can be made sustainable by doing two things: Lower the inflation (e.g. reduce it by 20x, bringing the PoW security to a blockchain such as Ethereum Classic). Completely removing inflation\u2014relying on transaction fees only\u2014would also be possible (see below for security argument). Use Ethereum 2.0 to regularly finalise Ethereum 1.0, counter-balancing the reduced security and preventing long-range 51% attacks. This requires Ethereum 1.0 nodes to be beacon chain light clients, which should take years to happen. If the community gets tired of Ethereum 1.0 a bomb mechanism (e.g. difficulty bomb, issuance bomb, gas bomb, etc.) can gracefully kill it. Another possibility is for Ethereum 1.0 to become a contract on Ethereum 2.0. I don't see this as a practical solution, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise :) [Justin Drake] A follow up: I'll add that if any specific user wants to migrate their application to the 2.0 chain, then they should be able to just take their existing high-level code (Solidity or Vyper), make relatively few changes and redeploy. The main difference between the eth1 and eth2 systems that users will need to worry about is likely to be rent (or equivalents like gas-payment-extended bounded TTLs). [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there a worry that shards will become \u201cgentrified\u201d until full shard interoperability? Basically, will one shard capture all the defi apps because they can't directly communicate with each other on separate shards? A: I would say if that happens, that will create a large incentive for someone to create a defi dapp that can interact with the other defi dapps through asynchronous cross-shard transactions and launch it on a cheaper shard. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: At the start in times of low usage, the economic load-balancing might result in over and under utilized shards. Overtime as usage increases, I expect the economic benefits of deploying and interacting on particular shards will become more tangible and result in a more economically rational distribution across shards. Observing the emergent behavior is going to be super fascinating :) [Danny Ryan] Q: Can we run the same validator on multiple machines - in order to avoid penalties if one machine was compromised ? If yes - what happens when we run a validator on 3 machines, one goes temporary offline, one is compromised, one is OK? A: For small amounts of ETH I'd recommend just running on one machine; unless many other validators get penalized at the same time as you, the penalties are not too large. If you do want to decentralize your validator, then we have recently made progress toward validation being more multi-party-computation friendly, which would allow you to run a validator as a 2-of-3. In that case, as long as two of the three sub-nodes are functioning correctly you'll be fine. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Yes! Ethereum 2.0 is friendly to n-of-m schemes thanks to BLS signatures. For example, with a 2-of-3 scheme you have can three computers, each with a share of the validator private key, such that two need to be online at any given time. This improves security as well, because an attacker now needs to compromise two of the BLS key shares. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there tech from any competitors such as Dfinity (or any others) that is worth adopting into Ethereum 2.0, or is the work all other dapp/smart contract platforms doing not relevant/good enough for ETH 2.0? A: Part of the job of the research team is to absorb good ideas from research papers and other blockchain projects. I keep a keen eye on technically interesting projects such as Dfinity, Coda, Zcash, etc. Competitors definitely also have good ideas, and learning from each other is part of the game :) [Justin Drake] Q: Do we need to run a full node to also earn from network fees or would the validator client handle this? A: Depends what you mean by \"full node\". The design of the sharding system is such that no one needs to run a node that verifies all of the data of all of the shards. A validator client validates the beacon chain and the specific shards that you get assigned to validate, and that is sufficient to earn network fees. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: The validator client should abstract the necessary tasks to get revenue from the different revenue streams. (This includes being a full node for the beacon chain and one shard at any given time, but that's a technicality you don't have to worry about.) [Justin Drake] Q: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. It's also the thing that scares me the most about the proposed design;i can see how they would really increase the security of the random sample selection process in addition to RANDAO but manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? A: Very interested to hear about the efforts currently underway at the EF and strategic partners/OEMs to design and manufacture the VDF hardware. We're working our way with various partners, including Synopsys, AWS, TSMC, GUC, etc. VDF announcements to come in February :) manufacturing hw is a costly, difficult endeavor often subject to unforeseen issues and delays. Right. The good news is that Ethereum 2.0 can launch just fine without VDFs, so we're not betting Ethereum 2.0 on the success of VDFs. The current plan is to have VDF hardware ready in 2020, but 2021 would also be acceptable. From a financial perspective, we may share the total costs (estimated at $15m) with Filecoin and other projects interested in VDFs. We are already sharing costs with Filecoin on viability studies. On that note is an economic incentive structure for running a VDF node being considered? Short answer: yes, of course :) Long answer: the ethresear.ch post provides a bit of clarity on that. highly specialized hw always connected providing a crucial function to the network it would be a prime target for potential adversaries to disrupt or compromise Right. The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to be online for normal operation, and even if everyone goes down it's not a huge deal. The main negative consequence is that dApps relying on unbiasable randomness will have to wait longer than expected for the random numbers to arrive. [Justin Drake] Q: zk-STARKs are powerful and I have been reading Eli\u2019s and the others paper on it. Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? I know Coda is planning on using Recursive zk-SNARKs to shrink chains but the lack of transparency is worrying. A: I don't see what fundamentally prevents them from happening. Recursive [any zero knowledge proof schemme] just means using the ZKP mechanism to make a ZKP of the ZKP's own verification procedure. The main challenge in practice is just that these verification procedures themselves have a high cost (eg. there's 50-500 kB worth of hashes in a STARK to verify), and this cost multiplied by the ZKP's overhead is quite a big number. ZK SNARK verification is in contrast much more \"concise\". [Vitalik Buterin] A2: Are recursive zk-STARKs ever doable? In theory yes, but as I understand recursive zk-STARKs won't make sense from a performance standpoint for most applications, at least in the medium term. [Justin Drake] Q: What\u2019s the final scalability limit of Ethereum post Serenity? Gas limits per block? Blocks per second? A: The current design has a fixed number of shards, at most one block per 6-second slot, and fixed block sizes. This means that the data bandwidth is capped. The gas limit on the other hand will likely be floating, just like Ethereum 1.0. [Justin Drake] A follow up: Though in the current phase 1 spec that's sitting around in draft mode the block size is so far fixed to 16 kB, as keeping it fixed makes the code for proofs of custody, data availability proofs, etc much simpler. If we want to bump up capacity later increasing the shard count may well be the simpler way to do it. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why should anyone move to the Beacon Chain? How exactly do you envision the move to happen? A: Why should anyone move to the beacon chain. Specifically, only validator balances exist in the Beacon Chain. User balances and state exist in the shard chains. Validators will move to the beacon chain to seek profit by providing security and resources to network. Note there is a new proposal to have the beacon chain finalize the PoW chain during the transition period so the validators would be able to provide security both to the new shards and the existing chain. Users will move to the shard chains to participate in the new scalable, sharded landscape. We envision economic activity to begin to move over as the system stabilizes and begins to show clear economic benefits to the users. It is important to note that a user could choose to not move until the eth1.0 state is rolled into a shard. How exactly do you envision the move to happen? At first, this will just be a single directional deposit for validators only to begin validation. Once the state execution layer is in the new 1024 shards, users will be able to transfer eth directly to the shards from the PoW chain. In the long term, the plan is to roll the PoW state into one of the shards. The current most favorable strategy from our perspective is to fork the PoW state root into a contract along with an EVM interpreter. Users could then execute txs on the existing eth1.0 state by call the contract along with the merkle witnesses of the state they need to access. This option is nice because it allows us to cleanly deprecate eth1.0 support in the long term. [Danny Ryan] A2: Moving to the beacon chain is done by sending ETH to a so-called \"deposit contract\" on Ethereum 1.0. People would send ETH to the beacon chain to become an Ethereum 2.0 validator and gain financial rewards. [Justin Drake] Q: How much funds does Ethereum foundation have and are these enough for finishing Eth 2.0? A: The EF has tens of millions of dollars in fiat, and a bunch of ETH. More than enough to finish ETH 2.0 :) [Justin Drake] Q: How is the status of a possibly fixed eth supply at some point in the future? Do you think it's likely? A: I don't know about fixed ETH supply, but we may get to a point of decreasing ETH supply. Indeed, we are looking into transaction fee schemes that burn ETH, and burnt ETH may outweigh minted ETH. [Justin Drake] Q: Have you looked into hyraxZK. They are zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup. Any thoughts on them being used in the future as the sizes are still very small. The only thing is they wouldnt be Quantum-Resistant but the proof size won\u2019t be similar to a zk-STARK. I wonder what they can be used for offchain as well, especially in networking by producing a zk proof of incoming packets that acts as Natural DDOS Protection. Just some thoughts. A: Have not looked into Hyrax specifically, but I am totally not surprised that things like it exist. I'm definitely very happy with the progress the general-purpose ZKP space has accomplished in the last few years; the very concept of general-purpose ZKP is pretty godlike compared to what I imagined was possible with cryptography as a child. Our general instinct is to find ways to make it possible to get the benefits of many different ZKP schemes with different tradeoffs in ethereum. The simplest way to do this would be to encourage the development of such tech as application-layer or network-layer addons so that it we do not need an agreement at consensus layer about a single ZKP scheme that everyone uses. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: V said that there are no fundamental problems left to solve. Is this true for only phase 0? If so, how confident are you about the other phases? A: Personally I am confident in all of the current fundamental technologies for all the phases outlined so far (Casper FFG and CBC, sharding, erasure coded data availability proofs, proofs of custody, receipt-based async transactions, layer 2 for acceleration, abstraction, rent, \"stateless client\" verification). There is definitely still a lot of room around the edges for optimization though. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why was Hybrid Casper ditched when it looks like the Beacon Chain kind of has nothing to do with the PoW chain? or Why not re-instate Hybrid Casper considering its testing is/was finalized? A: Honestly hybrid Casper is a bit of a dead end. Actually implementing/testing it across all the clients would require setting up a lot of infrastructure that we would then need to throw away. The design was highly inefficient because of its \"implemented-in-EVM\" nature, and it turned out that we could not really benefit from the ease-of-implementability of being done in EVM because we would need to write a lot of special-purpose code to make verification of signatures parallelizable. So we chose the route that would be somewhat more painful in the short term, but significantly lower headache to actually get to a stable sharded system overall. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: I wrote up some notes on the deprecation of EIP 1011 here https://notes.ethereum.org/s/rJDrKoBOQ [Danny Ryan] Q: 1. Since it is a one way transfer to the beacon chain, my understanding is that there will be two tokens: ETH1.0 and ETH2.0. Right? Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? Gutfeeling: how much \"unsolved computer science problems\" for phase 1, 2 and 3 roughly? I understood for phase zero it has arrived at 0. Will we consider some kind of tax baked into the system to ensure sustainability of core developments and infrastructure? A: Will The beacon chain allow tokens to be send. I.e. will exchanges be able to list the token before phase 2? ETH in the beacon chain would not be transferable (anywhere!) until phase 2. That will make exchanges harder, although we may see a futures' market. My guess is that we will see 1 ETH ~ 1 BETH at pretty much all times :) [Justin Drake] My feeling is that from a risk/reward perspective, stakers will expect returns more in the area of emerging market debt (+20%) esp. in the beginning. But all discussion I saw was ~2%. Any comments on this? The reward/penalty constants are certainly not yet finalized and could use more community debate and input. That said, the rate does scale depending on the number of validators participating. If the fair market rate is really 20%, then a lower number of validators will show up. If the fair rate is 2%, then a ton of validators will show up. The economics of staking will find the natural equilibrium. That said the main risk here is if we set the target rate too low and the equilibrium lands at a low participation rate (and thus low security of the network). Although ~2% (@ 10M eth validating) is not set in stone, the idea for a low rate is that a huge amount of ETH is already being held as a speculative asset. Any marginal rate of return on top of this already intended long-term hodling is a gain for the hodler. [Danny Ryan] Q: How would you (and or service providers) ensure the eth on the Beacon Chain is the same as that on the PoW chain and vice versa? A: Arbitrage is always possible in one direction by buying 1 BETH for 1 ETH. A key design goal of Ethereum 2.0 is full fungibility for ETH tokens between the Ethereum 1.0 chain, the beacon chain, and the shards. Two-way transfers between the beacon chain and the shards, as well as between shards, should come in phase 2. [Justin Drake] Follow up point: If you wait until phase 2 for two-way flow, you privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money. This will be great for those few (probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. Follow up A: y ou privilege the very few stakers able and willing to wait an undetermined number of years for access to their money The ultimate loyalty test :) probably north of 25% interest rates!) but not very great for security. We do have a minimum amount at stake to launch phase 0, around 214 * 32 ETH = 524,288 ETH. So we're effectively capping the interest rate (will be less than 25%) and setting a minimum security level. [Justin Drake] Q: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? A: For how long is the 32eth locked up when running a validator client? At least as long as you are a validator. Withdrawal times should be a few days/weeks/months depending on how many other validators are trying to withdraw. What happens if the machine I'm using gets destroyed or stolen during the lock up period? Can you switch machines? You can switch machines. You need a copy of your private keys in case your machine gets destroyed or stolen. Another thing is the withdrawal key used for withdrawals only. Keep that one in cold storage ideally. [Justin Drake] Q: Contributing to Ethereum 2.0? Are there any projects which are some sort of \"under water\", like only few people working on it. A: I feel at this point there are enough implementation teams, at least compared to some of the other issues that are underaddressed. Off the top of my head: Solidity being compile-able to E-WASM Vyper being compile-able to E-WASM Thinking about research problems related to phase 2, particularly around account abstraction, asynchronous contract programming models, etc Privacy, eg. see https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-we-should-value-privacy-more/2475 Improving the state of decentralized messaging and file storage [Vitalik Buterin] Follow up A: A few more things good to work on: liibp2p implementations in various languages Doing security reviews of the spec prototyping account and state execution in eWASM a lot of work in cross client testing coming up in the next couple of months [Danny Ryan] Q: We have experienced consecutive delays with Constantinople due to bugs found late in the process on a comparatively low risk / simple upgrade. What work is being done to mitigate this on Phase 0 and 1 given how much more complex these implementations will be? (I.e. What testing, third party audits, other considerations are being taken to ensure seamless implementation/integration? A: As the phase 0 spec is moving into a more stable place, we are beginning to look into explicitly bringing in third party audits, academics, and formal analysis. In addition to this, we are currently laying down the foundations of cross client testing and fuzzing akin to eth1.0. You're correct in that the consensus/system layer of eth2.0 is much more complex than the single PoW chain so we are constantly trying to reduce complexity and simplify. This is a major engineering effort that will require many parties other than our research team to plan, build, test, execute, and maintain. I think it is a major strength that so many independent teams with a diverse set of expertise have stepped up to contribute. Note, one of the design goals in the spec readme -- \"to minimize complexity, even at the cost of some losses in efficiency\" We're excited to see new efforts like the \"Ethereum Cat Herders\" and scheduled release cycles emerging in 1.0 and plan to incorporate any best practices and efforts into the 2.0 process. DePM (decentralized project management) is hard, but we continue to learn and continue to get better. [Danny Ryan] Q: How difficult will it be for 1.0 contracts to work on Serenity? Should developers expect to rewrite their contracts to account for state rent and cross-shard communication? A: Solidity can already compile to WASM and I believe it is in Vyper's roadmap to do so as well. These naive compilations might be inefficient (e.g. keeping 256 bit types in the 64bit wasm machine) so some amount of rewrite or utilization of optimizers might be called for. Beyond that, there are some unknowns that might change the approach to certain contract programming modesl. For example, storage fees might call for a new ERC20 contract design in which user balances are stored in separate child contracts so that users become responsible for managing their own storage fees related to their coins. [Danny Ryan] Q: What is the latest view on how the \"upgrade\" to Ethereum 2.0 will happen? Can you take us through the different phases/hardforks that will in the end enable the full PoS/sharded/WASM blockchain, and what each will enable? A: Eth2.0 is broadly divided into three phases -- Phase 0, 1, and 2. Phase 0 - The Beacon Chain This phase is the launch of the core system level functionality of the new PoS chain (the beacon chain). Validators can submit deposits, join the validator set, and build/finalize the core chain. At this point the chain will have Casper finality, an RNG, shuffling into the various validator roles, and simulate crosslinking in the (currently) non-existent shard chains. Phase 1 - Shard Chains (data) This phase is the launch of the shard chains, but only as a blockchain of data. (Execution and state comes in phase 2). At this point, validators will additionally build these data chains and finalize the each shard back into the beacon chain via \"crosslinks\" and attest the availability of the data. These crosslinks were already being created in Phase 0, but had a stub for the shard hash being finalized. In this phase, that hash becomes \"unstubbed\". Shard data chains begin to have some utility for applications that need a high availability data store. Phase 2 - Shard Chains (state and execution) This phase is the launch of state and execution of state (eWASM) on the shard chains. This is when users and applications will begin to migrate to Serenity and use it to it's full potential. Cross shard txs will be available at this point, and users can begin developing any number of \"layer 2\" execution engines on top. The above (especially phase 2) might be divided into sub-forks, and there will be a fork during/after phase 2 to bring in the eth1.0 state/evm into a contract. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm quoting James' article: \"This means there will be little reason to migrate smart contract code or users until Phase 4 is released, potentially in the mid-2020s\". Does this mean, ETH2.0 wont be usable before 2025? \"ETH2.0 designers do not know what the cross-shard communication system will look like.\" If you're so unsure about the features of ETH2.0, why is it being developed at all? What will be the advantages in daily use compared to EHT1.X? Why should anyone wait till \"the mid-2020s\" to use ETH2.0? A: 2025 sounds... unlikely! I publicly made the prediction (since July 2018) that phases 0, 1, 2 will come in 2019, 2020, 2021 respectively. Scaling from shards will come in phase 1 and phase 2. On the topic of timelines, for phase 0 specifically, ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses for phase 0. [Justin Drake] A2: I answered a related question here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeufhqb [Danny Ryan] Q: https://hackernoon.com/what-to-expect-when-eths-expecting-80cb4951afcd From the article above, this is what I understand as the timeline of Ethereum 2.0: Phase 0 will be available in year 2020 Phase 1 will be available in 2022 Phase 2 will be available in 2023/24 Given the above timeline, is it fair to say that DAPP's have to wait at least 4 years before they can run their smart contracts on top of Ethereum 2.0? A: Hi! That article is written by an independent engineer that has been following development so it is not necessarily our 1-to-1 opinion. That said, I'm only seeing the following in the article -- \"Which is to say, while ETH2.0 may launch this year, don\u2019t expect ETH2.0 to support asset transfer or smart contracts until at least 2020.\" I agree that assets and smart contracts won't be available in eth2.0 in 2019. At the latest, I expect phase 2 to launch in 2021, but we are building a complex system and can't say for sure what unexpected challenges might arise between now and then. Waiting until 2023/24 is entirely out of the question for phase 2 imo. [Danny Ryan] Q: With eWASM will we be able to write contracts in Rust and/or any language that compiles to WASM in addition to Solidity? Where can one find out more about that and/or potentially help out? Thanks :) A: Yes you will be able to write contracts in any language that compiles to WASM :) I expect specific toolkits/frameworks to spring up in the languages people are particularly interested in (e.g. Rust, go, typescript, etc) to aid in writing contracts in these languages. https://github.com/ewasm/design is a great place to get started. The eWASM team has compiled a ton of info here to understand the project from a high level. https://gitter.im/ewasm/Lobby The eWASM team and broader community congregate in this gitter room and I'm sure would be willing to provide more guidance and answer any questions you have. [Danny Ryan] Q: Hi guys, Would you like to implement an optional decentralized identity layer in the future? like an option to use DID's or something. so the user can use zero knowledge proofs for Dapps that requires some proof of credentials of the user. Greetz A: Decentralized identity systems are definitely very interesting, but imo out-of-scope for blockchain base layers. The good news is that it's a Turing-complete platform, so anyone can build one on top of ethereum (1.0 or 2.0), and yes that are teams working on different approaches to it already. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What is the one thing on eth 2.0 dev that keeps you up at night? A: In my mind the Ethereum 2.0 abstract design is a remarkably elegant/slick/simple design. I worry that we botch the spec with poor taste in some of the implementation details, or bugs that we miss. [Justin Drake] Q: How will the Eth1.0/PoW chain eventually be migrated over? A: See the bottom of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeucd4f tldr, fork into a stateless contract on a shard [Danny Ryan] A2: See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ [Justin Drake] Q: What are the current incentives for a person to run their own beacon node? A: It is a similar set of incentives as why you would run an eth1.0 node -- mining, run applications (block explorer, wallet services, dapp portal, etc), hobbyists wanting direct connection to the network, etc. If you are a validator, you will receive rewards for operating a node and signing consensus messages. If you run some sort of application, it can be beneficial to run a beacon chain to directly sync the shards you need. You also might serve light clients and applications as a business. I fully expect some some entities to experiment with this model. If you are a hobbyist, you might just like running the protocol directly for self-sovereignty :) [Danny Ryan] A2: Financial rewards through ETH inflation. I think Eric Conner has a spreadsheet somewhere. See https://twitter.com/econoar/status/1070713152864583682 for example here\u2014numbers presented here likely on the low side. [Justin Drake] Q: How do the researchers and developers feel about the complexity of ETH 2.0? A: We're definitely trying hard to bring the complexity down! Examples of complexity decreases that we've made in the last ~3 months include: Switching FFG from the \"per-block finalization\" model to a simpler epoch-based model Moving shard committee calculation outside the state Replacing the RANDAO hash onion construction with a simpler BLS construction (and same with the hash onion for proofs of custody) Storing validator state change slots in the validator record, making each validator's state transition process much more understandable Making shard blocks fixed size rather than variable size (which allows removing a lot of boilerplate for handling transitions) That said we recognize that there's still a way to go, and many features of eth2 don't feel neat and clean the way eg. Nakamoto PoW does. I personally hope a medium-term switch to Casper CBC (see https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/12/05/cbc_casper.html ) can mitigate some of that. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Is there any work being done on reducing the size of the blockchain as it grows? A: You mean the current chain or the 2.0 chain? Since this AMA is primarily about on the 2.0 chain I'll focus on that. The beacon chain state size is bounded, and there are no objects that hang around forever; even validator records disappear once either their balance drops too low or the validators exit voluntarily and then the withdrawal and exit waiting periods pass. On the shard chains, we're looking at ongoing storage maintenance fees for every byte of storage, \"hibernating\" accounts that do not pay up (at which point their users are responsible for storing and maintaining the data needed to revive those accounts if they need them). [Vitalik Buterin] A2: If you are talking about the Ethereum 1.0 chain size there are a number of workgroups in place and some of them deal with decreasing the chain state or slowing down chain state growth. See: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/meta-ring-to-discuss-and-coordinate-all-ethereum-1x-efforts/2048 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-1-dot-x-a-half-baked-roadmap-for-mainnet-improvements/1995 https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/state-rent-proposal-version-2-rushed/2494 [Hudson Jameson] Q: Inter-shard transactions - how do downstream shards protect themselves against kiting exploits (A->B B->C C->D where the transfer A->B is later challenged)?? I can imagine kiting tumblers that might make this a computationally intractable challenge. A: There isn't really a concept of \"challenging transfers\" in the current spec, and if you mean plain old fraud proofs then the answer is that if a block that was confirmed into a history turns out to be invalid then the entire history from that point on is invalid and should get discarded. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: If I deploy a contract in ETH 2.0 will it randomly be assigned to a shard? A: No. You specify the shard you want. You'll chose based on proximity to contracts of interest, and gas prices. (Each shard will have a separate gas market.) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though initial choice is not necessarily irreversible; contracts could be designed to be yanked ( https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-contract-yanking/1450 ) from one shard to another, and I expect a lot of applications will take advantage of this feature. Q: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? Also, will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? A: Will there be a software implementation of VDF for those who are unable to obtain the ASIC? A software implementation of the VDF would likely be useless for production. The current estimate is that a CPU implementation would be 1,000 to 10,000 times slower than the ASIC. A software implementation would be useful for testing though. will participants in the RANDAO/VDF mix earn rewards in a similar fashion to validators (if at all)? There will be a small incentive for validators to also be VDF evaluators. Other than that we're mostly drawing from external incentives (e.g. as a large ETH holder you have an incentive that Ethereum stays healthy). The good news is that we only need one VDF evaluator to do its job. There will be thousands of VDF rigs given for free to the community. [Justin Drake] Q: Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds and can they cause collisions with old contracts? A: One of the features of Ethereum 2.0 is \"abstraction\", which means that users can specify whatever signature scheme they want. I expect quantum-secure signature schemes to gradually become more popular. Burn addresses can easily be made quantum-secure. Do Quantum Computers pose a permanent threat to ownerless legacy addresses with significant funds Yes, definitely a threat. Ownerless legacy address could be a systemic risk for blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Would be interesting to guestimate how much ETH is at risk. Q: ERC20/721 standards' design sucks. Is there any idea or plan to convert current tokens to ERC-1155 like, efficient format? (Code isn't Law. Seriously.) A: I'm hoping that Ethereum 2.0 standards (such as token standards) can learn from the mistakes of Ethereum 1.0 and evolve. Starting from scratch is a unique opportunity in Ethereum's lifetime. [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Agree! There's a lot from ERC20 that I dislike, the main two things being: It being a pull system vs a push system, requiring the whole approve/transferFrom mess to use tokens to pay for things in smart contracts Handling of ETH being so different from handling of tokens Definitely would like to see both issues resolved in 2.0. The other big things I want to \"get right this time\" is (i) multisig wallets and (ii) not having the \"ether used to pay for gas to withdraw funds from a mixer contract being a deanonymization vector\" issue that makes privacy hard at the moment. Q: How soon will staking pools be live when Ethereum staking goes live? A: At the consensus layer we are trying hard to be friendly to decentralised staking pools. Hopefully we will see those soon after the launch of phase 0. The research and implementation work that Dfinity is doing regarding BLS Distributed Key Generation (DKG) will likely help decentralised pools. Centralised staking pools\u2014unlike centralised mining pools\u2014are somewhat awkward because you have to trust the operator to behave properly with your funds. [Justin Drake] Q: If we want to bring our smart contracts to a new chain, could we pre-determine the corresponding starting/ending hex values for the old smart contracts? Kind of reminds me of CREATE2... A: Yes, Eth2.0 will have a CREATE2 equivalent for deploying contracts. As for existing contracts, the entire eth1.0 state will be rolled into a contract on a shard and these existing contracts will be callable via calling into this 1.0 contract targeting the existing contract address. [Danny Ryan] Q: Are there any courses or subjects in uni that one should take to help in becoming a researcher? A: I'd say you need to be a good self-learner. Math, cryptography, computer science, programming, economics, networking are all relevant. [Justin Drake] Q: Of proposed ways to tackle state rent problem, which one is your favorite? What do you think about resulting complexity from user point of view? A: As far as base protocol goes, either option here: https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 The complexity is actually not so much in the rent itself, it's in how it changes the developer experience. The general approach is that application storage will need to be more \"modular\" and explicitly broken down into chunks associated with specific users, possibly with a fixed amount of \"global\" storage, plus some short-term storage not assigned to any user that goes away after some fixed amount of time, eg. 6 months. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Question for Justin Drake and other VDF researchers: Would using Chainlink and TEEs (Intel SGX) be a viable method of generating secure randomness for the VDF function of Eth 2.0? Could this be used in lieu of specialized hardware? If so, I imagine this could be a substantial time and cost saving measure in the quest for Serenity. A: TEEs can be used to generate randomness using delay. Unfortunately TEEs is trusted hardware. We need a trustless solution :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: Though I would add that trusted hardware could be a great thing for individual validators to use to increase their security. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What computer science problems still need to be solved prior to the release of Phase 1? A: For phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. Please message me if that sounds like your cup of tea :) [Justin Drake] Q: What happens to the beacon chain in the event of a controversial hardfork on the Eth 1.0 chain? Will two beacon chains form? If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? How will this affect the transition of the Eth 1.0 chain onto a Eth 2.0 shard? What safeguards are in place to ensure that malicious participants do not create unnecessary volatility between ETH & BETH during the year long transition from phase 0 to phase 2? It is my view that this trading pair must remain stable for a successful transition to take place. A: If not, what mechanism will the beacon chain use to determine which Eth 1.0 chain is the main chain? By default the beacon chain validators will just use the voting mechanism that's specified in the spec, and whichever chain a majority of the validators support is the chain that the beacon chain will go with. That said, if we want to facilitate a peaceful split, there is a fork versioning feature built in to the beacon chain to make replay protection very easy... [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Why are you not doing \"proper\" research and submit publications to conferences? A: Not really an answer to your question, but Ethresear.ch ( https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=\"ethresear.ch\"&btnG=&oq=\"et ) does get cited :) [Justin Drake] A follow-up: As does the Casper FFG paper! [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Let's say that I have some ethereum locked on a time locked contract, will be available after the 2.0 transition? This question can be expanded to all 1.0 contract functionality after the POS transition A: The Ethereum 1.0 will live on, even after Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. See https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeub9sp/ . [Justin Drake] Q: Thoughts on this tweet? https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/1088001513459511296?s=21 A: Eth 2.0 is not really trying to maintain backwards compatibility; almost every part of the design is significantly altered, and old contracts will have to explicitly migrate over to the new system and in some cases rewrite eg. to adapt to rent. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: What's your vision for Eth 3.0? A: STARKs, STARKs and lots of STARKs. Hopefully some nice way to achieve 2 second average block times. Extremely effective cross-shard communication, either at base layer or through a variety of easy-to-use layer 2 systems. [Vitalik Buterin] A2: See https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1072593728253104128 [Justin Drake] Q: In the future how will a really popular DAPP operate? Will it be possible for a single DAPP to operate across multiple shards? If not how will it operate properly with the TX/sec limits on a single shard? Will L2 solutions be the only option? A: A dApp would have to get really big to consume all the resources in a given shard to justify spreading itself over multiple shards. For example, Uber does less than 20 rides per second. A similarly popular decentralised equivalent would likely fit on a single shard, especially when fancy L2 infrastructure is involved (e.g. state channels, plasma, SNARKs/STARKs). [Justin Drake] Q: What is your take on the current state of finding consensus on randomness, in particular the current VDF construction. While certainly clever, I wouldn't say it is very elegant. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? More general, are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) A: I wouldn't say it is very elegant I'd say VDFs are a super elegant thin layer on top of RANDAO :) Is it the hardware you don't like? If so, would you agree that proof-of-work is an elegant solution? Then think of VDFs as being \"proof-of-work 2.0\": much better randomness at much lower cost. It's a paradigm shift from massively-parallel work to inherently-sequential work. Do you think this is due to theoretical constraints or do do you see potential for a 'nicer' way? I'm not aware of any unbiasable randomness schemes that only have strong liveness, other than VDFs :) are there any theoretical problems in this space, relevant to Ethereum 2.0 or not, that are just interesting to think about? (starting my PhD soon and looking for inspiration if it wasn't obvious) We will have an academic \"VDF day\" at Stanford on Feb 3 to work on open problems. Will you be nearby? [Justin Drake] Q: Shouldn't the smart contract stated in (4) have the ability of sending just 16 ETH for something as RocketPool v2 work (while some consider this to be \"centralization\" I think it will help a lot the average user and mitigate the risk of the average user)? A: You can send between 1 ETH and 32 ETH to the Ethereum 1.0 deposit contract at any time. A minimum balance of 32 ETH on the beacon chain is required for activation as a validator. [Justin Drake] Q: I see a lot of people talking about nodes running in cloud. Shouldn't ETH find a way to actually discourage this? If everybody is running nodes in cloud that means we have possible single point of failure, which is against what I think we are trying to achieve and what enterprise customers are looking to eliminate. A: \"Partial slashing\" and the quadratic leak during times of no-finality actually financially encourage diverse validator setups. Your potential losses are much smaller when your slashable message or validator down-time are discorrelated. Diversity in setup includes -- node software, validation software, local server vs cloud provider (and which cloud if using cloud), geographic region, etc. If a ton of validators all run on AWS and AWS goes down, these validators will suffer large penalty leaks. To guard against this, I should setup my validation node locally or on a less used cloud provider. [Danny Ryan] A2: We do have a way! It's called \"partial slashing\" and the idea is that, if something goes wrong, the more people did something wrong the more everyone gets penalised. So there is an incentive to avoid correlation with other validators, and hence avoid centralisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Can you foresee ever having to move Eth 1.0 to Eth 2.0 in order to avoid losing it forever? A: The current plan is to incorporate the eth1.0 state into a contract on a shard in eth2.0. Note that this will just be a state root and an EVM interpreter along with eth balances. Users will be able to call into this contract by providing merkle witnesses of the required state. [Danny Ryan] Q: I'm a new developer looking into Ethereum, where would you officially recommend I look to develop with an eye toward future proofing? A: A key consideration to future proof your contract code for Ethereum 2.0 is sustainable storage. It's known as \"storage rent\" and \"storage maintenance fees\". [Justin Drake] Q: What do you guys think of the Avalanche consensus mechanism and could it play a role in the ETH roadmap further into the future? A: Avalanche is interesting to me because it's a fresh approach. Looking forward to seeing how it plays out with Bitcoin Cash. Successes there can be ported to Ethereum via L2 infrastructure. [Justin Drake] Q: Is sharding smart contracts theoretically possible? How would one go about that? A: Here's a trivial example: the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be sharded across n shards according to the first log_2(n) bits in the domain name hash. [Justin Drake] Q: How does eth 2.0 balance security across shards holding different amounts of notional value in them? For example if there is a decentralized finance shard holding a very high % of eth + other tokens, would the stakers/validators responsible for that shard have incentives to behave badly? A: The key security guarantee of sharding comes from frequently shuffling validators into randomly-sampled committees (known as \"crosslink committees\"). The hope is that this fast shuffling resists bribing attacks, in both the \"honest majority\" and the \"slowly-adaptive rational majority\" security models. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: It still seems like an inefficiency where you'd be over-securing shards with low notional value + under-securing shards with high notional value. Am I thinking about this wrong? A: Every shard gets security with the same notional value. Value (validator collateral) gets spread evenly across shards. [Justin Drake] Follow-up Q: Ah think we are speaking past each other a bit, let me try to clarify my concern --> It seems likely you will have wildly varying ratios of (value sitting atop a particular shard / validator collateral securing that shard). So for example a defi shard with 90% of value in eth economy sitting in it only gets 1/1024th of the validator collateral securing it. And an empty or unused shard would get same 1/1024th of total validator collateral securing it. This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? A: This seems inefficient to me. Depending on how the distribution of value shakes out across shards, potentially materially inefficient? Oh I see! Interesting point. We consider every shard equal, and provide high security for all shards. The breakdown of even a single shard (namely, an unavailable or invalid crosslink) would likely be catastrophic for the whole system. [Justin Drake] Q: Will the Beacon Chain require its own nodes? Is this basically a brand new chain that has only one connection to ethereum: Proof of Burn? A: The beacon chain is a new system level chain that houses the validators and manages their responsibilities and rewards/penalties. In many ways this is akin to the FFG contract and sharding contract proposals that were previously deprecated but the organization breaks clean from the EVM to allow for a radically new design and increased efficiency. A node in the future can run the PoW chain and/or the beacon chain. If they run the beacon chain, they can then sync whatever shard chains they want. The connection at first is just an economic connection -- use the existing economics and community to seed validation in the beacon chain. Beyond that, we expect the beacon chain to be used to finalize the pow chain in the short to medium term. In the end, there are a number of proposals to either fork the eth1.0 state into eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: How does Eth 2.0 account for DDOS attacks? If people run nodes at home on consumer hardware with a normal internet connection they can be taken offline easily with DDOS attacks or am I interpreting this wrong? A: It is the responsibility of a validator to remain online to fulfill their responsibilities and gain rewards. A validator can remain profitable if they generally remain online greater than 50-67% of the time. A validator's inactivity penalties are also minimized if their being offline is dis-correlated from other validators. This incentivizes to utilize different node and validation software from the majority so that in the case of a ddos attack vector against a particular node implementation, your offline losses are minimized. The validator's protocol level identity and it's node's network identity are completely decoupled. This allows for a validator to create any type of obfuscated network setup that serves their purposes. I expect many tools and best practices to arise for home validators in the coming months. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are your thoughts on formal verification of smart contracts? Will this be possible with Ethereum 2.0? A: Formal verification of smart contracts is awesome and super valuable IMO. Formal verification will be possible in eth2.0. I believe the WASM semantics are already available in K which will provide some good opportunities for contract verification. Opening up more languages by using WASM will also allow for utilization of more restricted languages that are more amenable to FV. [Danny Ryan] Q: What are some good cypherpunk books that you would recommend to people getting interested in this space? (Or just good book recommendations in general) A: I don't read many books nowadays. I mostly consume academic papers, whitepapers, podcasts, videos, blog posts, Reddit, Twitter, etc. I did enjoy \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel when I was an entrepreneur. [Justin Drake] **Q: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? How are you solving the fast state syncing problem if nodes need to be reshuffled around shards? A: How do you prevent single shard corruption attacks? By randomly shuffling validators across shards. Basically will there be resharding? If so, how is resharding done? Right now crosslink committees are shuffled every epoch (6.4 minutes) and shard proposer committees are shuffled every ~9 days. Crosslink committees are critical, hence why there are shuffled fast. See this answer also. [Justin Drake] Q: You said in a comment some days ago that there are basically no unsolved problems of Serenity Phase 0 left. Which problems of Phase 1 and 2 are still left to be solved? A: The short answer is there are no big fundamental problems for phases 0, 1, 2. The more detailed answer is that for phase 0 we need locally-computable shuffles. For phase 1 we want a custody scheme that is friendly to decentralised pools. For phase 2 we need to figure out sustainable storage. [Justin Drake] Q: Before Eth 2.0 Enhancements come in, what is the best recommended approach for storing private data on Ehereum? A: Storing data on Ethereum is expensive per byte. Infrastructure like Filecoin may prove to be a good trustless storage solution. For privacy, just encrypt the data. [Justin Drake] Q: Will there be any zk-snarks related enhancements coming with Eth 2.0? A: We are hoping to have a SNARK- and STARK-friendly hash function in Ethereum 2.0 at some point. Unfortunately those likely won't be ready for phase 0. At the application layer, WASM will ideally mean that SNARK-specific precompiles won't be necessary. [Justin Drake] Q: Is there some kind of roadmap for the migration from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 in layman's terms? For true decentralization it is required to get more people on board that understand the full process. A: I described the three phases here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ajc9ip/ama_we_are_the_eth_20_research_team/eeueuzc EthHub also does a great job at simply describing the path https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/ [Danny Ryan] Q: ETH token will not be transferable back after migration to ETH2.0 What will be the token ticker for the ETH2.0 chain native token? A: ETH\u2014at least when Ethereum 2.0 is fully deployed. Fungibility is a key design goal. [Justin Drake] Q: Where does new client software take lists of peers with their ip addresses and ports? Is there is centralized server? A: This is an implementation detail. Some clients may have a hardcoded list of \"bootstrap node\" IPs and ports. [Justin Drake] **Q: Do you have any final plans in mind about the current ETH inflation? A: Nothing final. Ultimately the community will have to make a tradeoff between low inflation and high security. See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 . [Justin Drake] Q: What are the odds that a fully sharded chain including state transitions is feasible? A: Very high. No fundamental problems unsolved. The tricky part is getting everything to fit together cleanly. [Danny Ryan] Q: Can I use a raspberry Pi to stake when staking is possible? And what do I do with it in the mean time? A: Nimbus ( https://github.com/status-im/nimbus ) is targeting resource-constrained validators :) [Justin Drake] Q: What's your opinion of EOS (or TRON, STEEM) in terms of dapp platform? A: I tend to be critical of that class of systems. See https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html and https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html for reasons why. [Vitalik Buterin] Q: Any updates as far as overall inflation rate per year or per milestone/HF? Any updates as far as TPS per year or per milestone/HF? A: See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/251 [Justin Drake] Q: Can I make a Zcash coin on ETH 2.0 for example with all or most of the advantages of Zcash? A: Yes, there are already a number of experiments in eth1.0 to demonstrate usage of ZKSNARKs for both privacy and scalability. Check out miximus for privacy and roll up for scalability (both by barry whitehat!). Usage of ZKSNARKs will be supported in eWASM state execution so I expect more privacy solutions akin to Zcash to continue to be built on eth2.0. [Danny Ryan] Q: Why is ETH 2.0 Phase 0 even needed as a \"main\" chain, and need Bether transform from real ether (hence risk losing some value), instead of doing a testnet only, because after all this is what phase 0 is, based on TestnetBEther? A: ETH 2.0 needs a main chain as a single point of truth for all the shards. The reason we have phases 0, 1, 2 is to break things down conceptually, and in terms of incremental releases to limit risk. [Justin Drake] Q: What work is being done to make the research behind ETH 2.0 more geographically decentralized? Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? A: Are there any efforts to translate research specifications into other languages? Once the spec is more mature I expect the community to pick this up, somewhat similar to how Andreas's books get translated. English seems to be the a lingua franca for research and development. [Justin Drake] Q: After PoS, if a node gets hacked, can the hacker make the node to lose its stake by confirming false transactions? A: When your validator gets penalised it is automatically deregistered to prevent further damage. We have a mechanism called \"partial slashing\". The idea is that, if something goes wrong with your validator it only gets penalised a bit if not many other validators also mess up around that time. So in the optimistic case of a lone hack you should recover most of your funds with your withdrawal key (kept secure, e.g. in cold storage). [Justin Drake] Q: Will contracts be able to pay for gas in Eth 2.0? A: That will likely be unlocked with abstraction (which includes gas abstraction). [Justin Drake] Q: Assuming the number of network nodes remains the same and the network graduates to full PoS... what is your expected maximum theoretical transaction throughout? A: Rough ballpark figures. 1024 shards * 10 transactions per second per shard ~= 10k transactions per second. [Justin Drake] Q: What is the most updated timeline for rolling out PoS? Since Vitalik already said 'research is done', what are developers' incentives to push things forward? Are there any specific measures taken to ensure a smooth transition? A: I expect the beacon chain (the core PoS chain) to launch late 2019. Ideally the spec should be close to final in Q1, cross-client testnets in Q2, security audits in Q3, mainnet launch in Q4. As a rule of thumb, launching in December is hard because of the holiday season. So November 2019 and January 2020 would be my two best guesses. Having the Ethereum 2.0 chain finalise the Ethereum 1.0 chain will take more time. [Justin Drake] Q: Will it be possible with sharding to have shards with different rules and/or technology independent from the other shards/beacon chain, but still using the same base tech in terms of transacting and security? For example: private eth network run in a shard connected to main eth network from which it takes just security from validators. Private transaction with ZKsnarks shard(s). Encrypted data shards. Erc20 like coin launched on ETH 2.0, but with it's own rules and maybe own shards somehow controlled by the smart contract of that erc20. A: Every shard has the same data availability layer, and the option to use EVM2.0 as an execution engine. That's common base-layer infrastructure. At the application layer contracts can be powered by non-EVM2.0 execution engines (so-called alternative execution engines). There's also a huge L2 design around state channels, plasma, cross-shard communication, etc. So at the application layer I expect lots of non-homogeneity across shards, as well as a lots of homogeneity thanks to standardisation. [Justin Drake] Q: Today, running full nodes isn\u2019t that hard, but the resource requirements are slowly increasing. How much thinking is being devoted to the greater infrastructure requirements of Eth 2.0 and how they will impact node participation and decentralization? A: Ethereum 2.0 validation should be sustainable from a resource perspective: Bandwidth: fixed cost (thanks for fixes shard block sizes) Storage: if not fixed then sustainable (thanks to ideas such as storage maintenance fees). Note that storing shard blocks since genesis is not required. CPU, memory I/O: similar situation to Ethereum 1.0 (gas limit that can be voted up or down). [Justin Drake] Q: How ETH 2.0 differs from ETH, and why POS instead of POW. A: PoS enables goodies such as economic finality and sharding. It is also much cheaper (in terms of inflation cost for hodlers, as well as ecologically) than PoW. [Justin Drake]","title":"Part 1"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#part-2","text":"Q: What do you feel is the biggest unsolved challenge left in Eth 2.0 research which must be addressed before Phase 1 or Phase 2 could be implemented in the future? A: I really honestly think that there are no unsolved research challenges at this point. It's mostly \"how do we make this thing more elegant and take up fewer lines of code and have fewer edge cases\" on the research side. [Vitalik] Better understanding the incentives and various actors that might arise in a stateless and highly abstracted execution model. There is really great work being led by both the EF eWASM team and the Consensys Quilt team to better understand the design space and active build prototypes to vet ideas. [Danny] Q: Previously, a release date of January 2020 for Phase 0 was informally articulated. Do you feel this date is realistic and achievable? A: Thanks for noting its informality. :) Launching early next year is my personal target, but there is a lot that needs to be done before then! We need: long-running test nets (however that is defined), formal verification of the deposit contract, and clients to be ready for prime time, but right now it looks like everything will come together in time. We also don't want to rush clients into developing buggy software just to be ready by an arbitrary date. If anything, I think BLS standardisation efforts are the most likely to slow us down. We (as a greater blockchain community) are trying very hard to have a standardised signature scheme for better interoperability between all the chains. There is a high degree of consensus on this already, but establishing a new standard is always a slow process. [Carl] The client teams are doing a great job and continuing to push the envelope. I expect exciting progress to be made in the coming months, but I also expect that the last mile might be long. Early 2020 is realistic and still the target. [Danny] Q: Are the researchers happy with the current state of the economics of Ethereum 2.0? A: I don't think it's productive for us to worry about the absolute numbers at this point; the network will launch, and either the rewards will prove sufficient or they won't. The other thing worth worrying about is centralization incentives, but that's difficult to work out \"in theory land\"; much of the result in practice has to do with how lazy people are. [Vitalik] Q: My biggest worry about ETH 2.0 is that it will kill composability. Won't most dapps end up trying to build on the same shard as say MakerDAO so they can use Dai? A: Composability between shards is definitely unchartered territory but there are reasons to be optimistic: The shards are designed for homogeneity (unlike, say, Polkadot or Cosmos) to facilitate cross-shard communication. There are design patterns which abstract away the boundaries between shards. For example, one could consider shards 0 and 1 as a combined data availability substrate for an execution engine which requires more bandwidth. These design patterns will be more easily exploitable in the context of programmable execution engines. The shards are designed to be friendly to \"fast optimistic finality\" thanks to shard attestations which are somewhat analogous to block confirmations in the context of Eth1. What this means that is, in practice, the shards may act as one logical blockchain thanks to quick probabilistic finality of individual shards. The UI layer is also an opportunity to abstract away the boundary between shards. [Justin] Q: When can we expect the Beacon Chain to be finalizing/checkpointing the Eth1.x chain? A: My best guess is early 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: Under the specs there is a \" block.eth1_data \" property; based on that I thought that somehow we were going to have an hybrid validation starting Jan 2020 (if all goes well) from both PoW and PoS. As stakers, what are we going to validate except the validators, staking rewards & penalties if all the traffic will still be on eth 1.0 and we're not taking part? A: In order for Eth2 to finalise Eth1, 2 things are needed, Eth2 must vote on Eth1 (as is implemented as you point out) and Eth1 must change its fork rule to follow the finalised blocks on Eth1. The latter requirement requires an Eth1 hardfork. It is therefore easier to just have validator finalise the things you mention for now and later on add in Eth1 finalisation. Additionally, it is safer to launch without Eth1 finalisation in case of a Eth2 black-swan event in the early days. [Carl] Q: Rebuttals to the criticism that Eth 2.0 is extremely complex? A: It got considerably simpler over the last year. If you do a word count on the spec, it seems to be considerably smaller than the yellow paper at this point. There's a lot of things in eth2 that are much simpler than eth1. But there's definitely lingering complexity and I deeply care about minimizing it. [Vitalik] While the research path has been somewhat tortuous and hard to follow, the end product is arguably simple and clean. Expect more educational material highlighting the simplicity of the current design. Phase 0 is about 1024 lines of code to specify (assuming SHA256 and BLS12-381 as primitives). I expect phases 1 and 2 to be 1024 lines of code combined (assuming WASM as primitive). That's just the phase 0 consensus (deposit contract, beacon chain state transition function, and beacon chain fork choice rule). [Justin] Q: Why are there so many teams building eth2.0 clients? I understand the point of client diversity but don't you think 6 clients seem to be pushing it? Supporting so many clients would also divide the resources in terms of funding. Which clients do you see as the geth and parity of eth2.0? A: A few notes on client diversity: There's more than 6 clients being developed\u2014it's closer to 8. I expect consolidation\u2014a bunch of clients may not survive 2020. I expect specialisation\u2014one can focus on the browser (e.g. Lodestar), resource-constrained devices (e.g. Nimbus), the enterprise (e.g. Artemis), prototyping (e.g. Trinity), etc. A minimum of two production-ready clients are necessary for launch. I expect the first-mover advantage to be strong. All the above have, to an extent, historically happened on Eth1. [Carl] We definitely don't want a duopoly! For me personally, the ideal would be to have no single client exceed 1/3 of the network, so any software bug in any single client would not stop the network. Though having no single client exceed 1/2 is ok too and gets us most of the same benefit (if a major client has a bug, having no finality for a while while things are being figured out may even be an improvement...) I expect a power law distribution, and it's definitely likely that some of the clients will not survive to see significant usage on mainnet. [Vitalik] My guess on why so many clients showed up to do the hard work is that eth2.0 is both exciting as a purely technical challenge as well as a chance to make a mark on Ethereum and the crypto space in general. I'm pleased that there are so many great teams doing the hard work, but recently, I've been more focused on finding contributors to do value-add work outside of the core client implementation. Formal verification, academic analysis of protocols, testing, light clients, web3 interfaces and developer tooling, validator clients with great UX that plug into any underlying node, etc, etc. [Danny] Q: Are the Ethereum 2.0 clients eventually going to replace the 1.0 counterparts? For example, will Prism ever get merged to Geth? A: I expect the Eth1 clients to live a long and prosperous life :) On Prism: \"Likely not. Other than the language (Go), Prysm and Geth have very little in common.\" [Justin] Q: what happens when I stake 32 eth, and get slashed once? now that my stake is below 32 eth do i get kicked out of the validator set? A: Validators get kicked out when they get slashed. There is another ejection mechanism if your balance goes below 16 ETH from accumulating (non-slashing) penalties. [Justin] You also lose some amount of ETH. The minimum being set to 1 ETH currently. There is an additional penalty related to the number of other slashable offenses that have occurred in the recent time period. If more validators have been slashed recently, you lose more ETH. The maximum penalty occurs if ~1/3 of validators have been slashed recently, at which point you lose all ETH. This highlights the importance of having a discorrelated validator setup from other nodes and potentially having some fault tolerance setup with yourself before you sign things. [Danny] Q: What are the non-slashing offences? A: There are micro-penalties for not voting to finalise the same blocks as other validators and the inactivity penalty (for offline validators) for when the chain is not finalising for an extended period of time. [Carl] We have a bunch of micro-penalties for not optimally crafting attestations and penalties for being offline (search for get_attestation_deltasand get_crosslink_deltas here ). [Justin] Q: i hear a lot of hype around staking rewards, but what are the penalties for getting slashed? does the network have different punishments for different misbehavior (offline vs. double-signing)? is the \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\" still correct? A: I think you are conflating two thigs here, slashing and the inactivity leak. Inactivity leak If your validator node goes offline for 18 days, and the beacon chain is not finalizing, then your balance will be reduced by \"up to 60.8% slash in 18 days\". Slashing If a validator behaves provably maliciously, then they are slashed by having their balance reduced. Assuming client software is written well, this should be basically impossible to happen to you. Minimum penalty is 1 ETH, but it goes up linearly in the number of people slashed at the same time as you. See here for more [Carl] Important to note that if you are offline, but the chain is still finalizing you only stand to lose approximately the same as you would have gained. The quick reduction in balance over a ~2 week period only occurs when not finalizing. Another reason to have a discorrelated setup from the rest of the network! [Danny] Q:What is currently the most exciting new research development in Ethereum 2.0? A: The execution engine abstraction in phase 2 is quite exciting, taking account abstraction to the next level. It allows for the consensus part of execution to be an ultra thin layer of abstraction on top of data availability. Assuming WASM as a black box, it may be on the order of 256 lines of code to specify. There's an initial proposal from Vitalik here . The idea is that even the notion of a \"transaction\" is an application-layer detail which can be specified as WASM code. Compare this to Eth1 which \"enshrines\" an opinionated notion of replay protection (nonces), signatures (ECDSA), contracts, accounts (vs UTXOs), gas, storage, etc. [Justin] I'm lately most excited about this . The OVM work by Karl Floersch and co is along similar lines and also very interesting. [Vitalik] Q: Theres been some debate over the necessity of ASICs in Eth 2.0. I understand theres an effort to spread the cost out among various communities, but I think many people feel this might just end up being an expensive science project where the rewards dont justify the costs and if you itemised Eth 2.0, it seems like it might be the most expensive part. Are there alternatives besides relying on just Randao/Randao + ASICs (VDF)? What are the ELI5 upsides + downsides of the alternatives? I appreciate that the researchers are a tackling a difficult problem with randomness for a blockchain. A: It's important to stress that the VDF mechanism's safety is not critical to the safety of the Eth2 consensus; if the VDF scheme gets broken or someone makes an ASIC fast enough to predict all the outputs, all that happens is that the percentage of validators they need to corrupt a single committee drops by a few percentage points (think, from ~50% to ~33-40% plus a lot of computing power). I actually think the main value of the VDF is that it provides global trustable secure randomness to applications that need it. [Vitalik] +1 on consensus-layer security and/or performance gains, and value-add at the application-layer. The other \"promise\" of VDFs is that they are a new cryptographic building block with the rather unique notion of time. They can used for proofs of space, proofs of replication, proofs of history, anti-frontrunning, expiring zk-proofs, and hopefully further applications which are hard to predict today. [Justin] Q: I'd like to know more about the data availability layer of Ethereum 2.0 - particularly the economic costs of long-term data storage. Part of my political platform includes integrating blockchain technology with government operations. For example, I'd like to see all of America's public records stored on a public, open source, sufficiently decentralized blockchain. Would it make sense to build something like this on top of Ethereum 2.0? Why or why not? A: Realistically you would want an incentivized data storage platform like Swarm, with hashes of the documents stored on the ethereum blockchain. But I'd recommend thinking harder and trying to figure out how to answer the deeper question \"how could we use blockchains as a tool to minimize opportunities for misbehavior in government?\" Places to start I can think of include: Things like https://opencerts.io/ for all government-issued records Using https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413/ to do online votes, starting in low-security contexts (I think petitions would be a good place to start and underexplored) An internal-use stablecoin where only government agencies can hold balances but transactions are visible to and auditable by the public Some kind of zero-knowledge privacy-preserving sales tax collection thing Blockchain-based solutions for esoteric government things like spectrum auctions Get your country (I'm speaking generically to all readers here :D) to make an Estonian-style E-ID system that lets people make digital signatures that can be verified by anyone publicly. This is not technically a blockchain application, but it would be a tool useful in many blockchain applications [Vitalik] Q: I recall /u/bobthesponge once saying that almost his entire Net worth is in Ether (even his salary from the EF). Are there any other researchers on the research team that are as convinced of Ethereum's future, besides Vitalik and Justin of course? No need to call someone out. Just percentages, ie. \"Over 50% of the research team is heavily (over 30% of net worth) invested in Ether financially\", would be sufficient. A: Somewhat ingrained in our culture, the research team doesn't talk much about net worths. Having said that, the research team has a lot of fresh blood (e.g. Dankrad, Proto, Carl) which I don't expect to be crazy invested in ETH.[Justin] I am not an eth whale, but I get paid in eth and have high exposure. [Danny] The aforementioned Carl here, let's put it this way: financially, emotionally, and intellectually, I am heavily exposed to ETH. [Carl] Q: How many Eth2.0 client teams have to have a finished client for the Beacon chain to go live? A: I asked the same question a few days ago. At this moment, it is still an open question and will likely be until much loser to the time. Obviously having more clients is better, but that should be played off against the launch date. I am currently torn between 2 and 3. (Having > 2 would be great because otherwise there is a client guaranteed to have a majority of the validator-base.) At the end of the day, it will come down to who is ready and when. [Carl] Two at minimum, ideally three. [Justin] Q: I understand that about 10 million eth is expected to provide good enough security for the network. In a hypothetical scenario, what happens in the situation where a large organization manage to secure more than 50% of the total eth staked and use it to maliciously attack the network? As i understand, the side with less total eth staked will be slashed, so won't this malicious actor be able to effectively kill the network? A: If a large actor were to aquire a large enough stake to take over the network they would need to buy >2/3 of the total staking supply which would drive the price up, so it's not a cheap attack in the first place. Secondly, you are not slashed if you vote for a minority chain, only if you behave provably maliciously in the eyes of 2/3 of the validators. One of the beautiful things about PoS is that these attacks can be handled with grace. We, as a community, can go in and hard-fork out the malicious actors so they have no more voting power. The malicious actors just burnt a lot of money to temporally halt a network. In PoW, by contrast, if someone buys ASICS with 51% hash power, there is no way to remove them from the system. [Carl] Q:Do the client teams feel their implementations will be sufficiently robust enough, stable enough, and easy enough to use that normal nerds (like myself) can safely run their node software, stake 32 ETH on it, and not be slashed or lose ETH due to client bugs? My biggest concern is losing ETH while being a well intentioned actor. I've ran Geth, Parity, Trinity, and EthereumJ (Harmony) nodes for multiple years now and those clients have been around a lot longer than any of the ETH 2.0 clients have, but they still have issues, still have bugs, still sometimes crash. A: I hope so! One key component in the incentive design is that penalties (for going offline and for being slashed) are only high if many other validators go offline at the same time. So any bug that doesn't hit every node at the same time should only cost you a minimal amount. [Vitalik] Q:suppose ethereum reaches 1 mllion tps, ledger size will grow 1 terabyte everyday, any solution to this? what is your projections in terms of ledger size growh and what is your solution to this A: The sharded eth2.0 is expected to handle ~10MB/s of data availability. This is data that is come to consensus upon in shard chains and guaranteed to be available in at least the ~2 week time frame. This is not necessarily state size. The current approach to state and state execution is to take a \"state-less\" approach in which blocks must contain the merkle witnesses of the relevant state to perform the tx executions. This is reduces the amount of state any consensus node must store, but does bring up other issues about state size, who stores it, how users get it, etc. In fact, the entirety of state execution is being abstracted away such that we can experiment with multiple schemes to deal with this problem (state rent, users/dapps storing their own data, etc). Much of the state rent research that @ledgerwatch has driven in the past year or so will likely come into play. [Danny] Q: Lets assume you are a guy with very little cryptotech-knowledge, but you do have >32 ETHER. Question #1: Would staking be made easy-to-do, so \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? Question #2: Does staking pose any risks of losing ETH by accident? Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network (eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise) A: Would staking be made easy-to-do, s\u00e5 \"ordinary\" people can earn interest on their holdings? I expect a cottage industry will be setup around accessibility. Infrastructure to be built includes staking pools (centralised\u2014think Coinbase\u2014as well as decentralised one) as well as plug-and-play \"validator in a box\" solutions. Trying to understand if you can stake without any risks unless you \"intentionally\" try to harm the network That's definitely the goal. eg. if your validator node goes offline, because your internet provider has an issue and likewise Penalties should be marginal for validator nodes that go offline for short periods of time every once in a while. [Justin] Q: What is the current thinking around the Eth1>Eth2 migration plan? A: The current approach is to fold eth1 into eth2 as an execution environment. In practice, this will mean that we would need to have a hard fork on the eth1 side to rebalance some gas costs (opcodes that read storage or read accounts would see their gas costs increased to 2000-10000), and after that at some point there will be a \"flag block height\" from which the eth1 state root will be moved into the eth2 system (or possibly some one-time processing will be run on the eth1 state to make some optimizations, eg. replacing the patricia hex trie with a binary tree) and after that eth1 will be part of eth2, with applications being able to run as before. I do think the likely gas cost increase of storage/account reading opcodes (basically the same opcodes whose gas costs were already increased in Tangerine Whistle; those costs will need to go up at least another order of magnitude) is something that contract devs should be aware and plan for. The reason that change will be necessary is that those opcodes greatly increase the size of a Merkle proof needed to statelessly verify a block, so currently Merkle proofs for a worst-case block are >100 MB; with those gas repricings plus trie optimization plus charging per byte of any contract being read, we could get it down to acceptable levels. [Vitalik] Q: Regarding Proof-of-Stake and wealth distribution (and issuance reduction), by the looks of it the majority of ETH will be held by the minority of entities, does that cause any concern since a single entity can run multiple validator nodes (and earn more rewards)? It's a question from inequality perspective not security; if ETH were to take a significant role in the global economy, wouldn't this widen the gap between rich and poor by orders of magnitude (MUCH worse than the current economic system)? Basically, economic inequality on steroids. A: I definitely think income inequality issues from crypto are an issue! It's a big part of why I am not a single-cryptocurrency maximalist. But I still think that PoW is not better than PoS from an inequality point of view, because although PoW does distribute coins into \"fresh hands\", you need so much capital to become a PoW miner that PoW itself is a big rich-get-richer mechanic in practice. [Vitalik] Q: I know its still early but are there some rough estimates of when we might see Spec freezes for Phase 1 and 2? A: Phase 2 is a bit too far out to say, but my hope for phase 1 is Q3/4 of this year. [Carl] That said, the current minimal execution design with EEs for phase 2 (once better researched and prototyped) is a super simple addition on top of phase 1 [Danny] Q: Please ELI5 (\"explain like I'm five\") why the need for a second chain instead keeping on evolving the first one? A: Building Eth2 on Eth1 would be a bad design decision for a few reasons: We would be constrained by the Eth1 gas limit, which would severely affect performance (e.g. 1024 shards and 32 ETH to validate would not be possible). We would be mixing the consensus and application layers. This means the consensus layer is subject to the application-layer DoS vectors (e.g. high gas prices). It would also mean \"enshrining\" application-layer contracts, which is far from ideal from a governance standpoint which should be as neutral as possible with regards to deployed contracts (i.e. The DAO interventions should be the exception, not the norm). We would be constrained by the EVM, which is notoriously hard to safely program complex contracts in. Eth1 does not have support for BLS12-381. We would be subject to the Eth1 block time Poisson distribution (as opposed to the regular\u2014and shorter\u2014slots durations in Eth2). The list goes on :) [Justin] Q: I am considering to stake during phase 0, but i am a bit concerned about the inactivity leak. I want to know how to stop/pause being a validator if I change my mind? I am asking this as there may be certain situations in which I think I will be offline for a while, and I do not want my balance to slowly leak out due to that. A: You will only suffer large penalties if you are offline at the same time that >1/3 of other validators are offline. Otherwise the penalties for being offline will be tiny, to the point where you will be net-profitable (not including computer costs etc) as long as you are online more than ~50-67% of the time. The incentives are deliberately designed to be forgiving to avoid discouraging amateur setups to promote decentralization. [Vitalik] The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Q: 1024 shards, 131,000+ validator slots... what happens if there aren't enough validator slots filled by the time sharding goes live? A: With 1024 shards, and 128 validators in a committee, a minimum of 131,072 validators are needed to crosslink every shard every slot. If there are fewer validators than this, then shards are skipped to ensure the 128/committee validator number. [Carl] The system can naturally handle as low as ~64 validators. In this case, security is obviously insanely degraded, but the protocol can technically move forward. [Danny] Technically the system can \"move forward\" with one validator :D But yes, below the 131,072 validator (4.1M ETH) level the properties of the system progressively degrade as the number of validators goes lower and lower. [Vitalik] Q: if i understand finalization correctly, the more validators you have the longer it takes to finalize. how is eth2 addressing this issue without pounding the network with tons of messages being sent between all the validators? A: Correct. I wrote an article about this fundamental tradeoff here: https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735 We managed to get a couple orders of magnitude more favorable tradeoff curve than other projects through BLS signature aggregation, which reduces the marginal cost of a signature to 1 bit of data and 1 ECADD (~0.001 traditional signature verifications) of computation. [Vitalik] In Eth2, more validators should not lead to (significantly) longer finalization times. By making use of BLS signature aggregation and by grouping the validators into committees, we're able to support hundreds of thousands (and hopefully into the millions) of validators. [Carl] Q: Has the EF given any thought to maybe issuing \"official\" NFTs (i.e. collectibles) to initial stakers upon the launch of Beacon Chain as an \"extra incentive\"? What's your opinion on this? I'd say this would be the remit of the community, not the EF. Note that the Eth2 designers avoided giving early validators a special reward (e.g. giving the first 16,384 validators a 1 ETH bounty) to avoid distorting the economic experiment. We want to learn whether or not the basic incentivises are sufficient to incentivise participation. [Justin] I actually like the idea of an NFT. The deposit contract is readable in such a way that proofs can be made to a separate contract to generate NFTs. Been talking to Austin Griffith about this. He/burner-wallet might take the charge. I don't think an NFT would hinder our ability to understand the pure incentivizes here. It's at best a trophy and of little economic value imo. [Danny] Q: How is the work on evaluating the feasibility of producing dedicated VDF hardware coming along? A: At this point there's reasonably high confidence that VDFs (including building hardware) are viable. A few updates: A team of 3 ex-Intel people (Simon, Sean, Kelly from Supranational) is dedicated to the hardware aspects. The Rivest timelock challenge (open for 20 years, designed to last 35 years) was cracked in a few months using an FPGA (see here, and here). There's also code on Github. Work by Erdinc Ozturk has improved the state-of-the-art circuit depth for the modular exponentiation in VDFs. The ePrint paper was submitted a few days ago and should be published soon. A prominent complexity theorist (Ryan Williams from MIT) is working on circuit depth lower bounds for modular multiplication. Significant progress was made by Ligero on the RSA ceremony. We are planning for a ceremony with unprecedented scale (1024 participants) in 2020. New research papers keep flowing in\u2014see http://vdfresearch.org The $100K FPGA competition is starting in a few weeks. We have relevant corporate sponsors for the FPGA and ASIC competitions. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation and Protocol Labs (i.e. Filecoin), a new blockchain project (to be announced with the FPGA competition) is helping with funding. $900K was raised in the latest round of funding. [Justin] Q: Is there a chance for obligatory anonymity of future validator withdrawals? Force every withdrawal to go to a shielded pool - like zcash does with mining rewards. I fear without the obligatory anonymity here just using a mixer/etc is going to be treated as extremely suspicious - forcing stakers would add plausible deniability. A: I definitely support moving toward more and more privacy being a default over time! I'd say validator deposits are more important to mix than withdrawals, as that way it becomes harder to locate the nodes of specific validators which seems like it would increase security and censorship resistance. [Vitalik] Q: What are the main incentives to run a beacon node for validators if they can just connect to high-up time beacon nodes?If there are beacon node providers with high up-time - how is this going to be decentralized? A: There is an anti-centralisation incentive mechanism baked in. Basically, validators get punished for going offline the more other validators are offline at the same time. So \"uncorrelated downtime\" should be optimised in addition to \"high uptime\". [Justin] Q: If, as a validator, I know that I'm going to be offline for a period of time, is is possible to 'pause' validating without suffering an inactivity leak? A: The closest to a \"pause\" button is to first exit (which can take as little as half an hour, but may take days/weeks since there's a queuing mechanism) and later re-activate. [Justin] Clarification: there's a minimum ~1 day period before you can withdraw after you exit. It's safe to be offline during that time, but it does prevent you from re-entering. If we want to, in some future version we could add a \"re-enter\" feature that allows immediate re-depositing without waiting to withdraw first.... there's no theoretical reason why such a thing would not be possible. [Vitalik] Q: Do we have clarity yet on whether currently locked-down smart contracts (eg metronomes 4 contracts by Jeff garzik) will continue to work seamless in ETH2.0 or whether these contracts will be deprecated with all ETH in them lost? And how can storage costs be added to locked-down contracts in ETH 1.x ? In other words can we all assume immutable contracts on ETH1.0 will continue to work forever (provided enough people want them to)? Thx A: The current plan is that eth1 will be folded into eth2 as an execution environment via the stateless client approach, in which case, yes, contracts will keep working as expected. [Vitalik] Q: According to this paper, it may be possible for Quantum Computers to hijack and re-sign transactions DURING BLOCKTIME by (as early as) 2027. In other words, ownership of ANY wallet that has not upgraded to a quantum secure signature scheme BEFORE THEN can no longer be trusted AT ALL (even WITHOUT previous outgoing transactions). SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: Is anyone who fails to manually upgrade their wallets before a deadline (in order to become quantum secure) guaranteed to lose their funds after the advent of Quantum Computers? For example, if someone stores a PAPER WALLET for let's say 20 years, are they going to lose their funds by that time? Can QCs just monitor the entire blockchain and automatically attempt to hijack any transaction with insecure signature scheme during one blocktime, even if the sender has no previous outgoing transactions? A: Even if a quantum computer gets announced as immediately usable tomorrow, it is possible to do an emergency procedure to secure the funds of everyone who has not yet publicly released their public key or a signature (ie. every standard account holder that has not signed a transaction). You do this by doing a soft fork to disallow standard transactions, and replace them with a special transaction type that uses a STARK to prove that you own the private key k such that the given address A equals to hash(G * k)[12:] , and then moves the funds over into a new address type that uses a quantum-secure signature scheme, eg. Winternitz signatures. If we get more warning, then we can get people to update to Winternitz on an orderly schedule. TLDR: we're fine. [Vitalik] Q: how do/will the performance bottlenecks compare between 1.x and 2.0 A: 2.0 removes the disk I/O bottleneck for consensus participants by heavily leaning towards stateless clients. Finality greatly mitigates the sync latency bottleneck, and the requirement for consensus participants to store historical blocks. [Justin] I'd also add that I expect light clients to be massively more viable in eth2 than in eth1. About the same order of magnitude load as a bitcoin light client to stay synced (as opposed to eth1, where light clients are not light enough in practice to run on phones...) [Vitalik] Q: As an ETH miner, my main concern is how to prep for ETH 2.0. Any wiki, tips, or advice on how to proceed contributing (and profiting) for Ethereum? A: Eth2 has no mining. You may be able to put those GPUs to good use at the application layer with protocols like Golem, or maybe protocols that incentivise GPU-accelerated SNARK proofs. [Justin] Q: Approximately when is ETH issuance supposed to drop dramatically? (I believe the figure I've come accross is 10x reduction in issuance, is this correct also?) A: When the PoW chain starts piggybacking on the PoS chain for security (this could happen during phase 1 or phase 2), it becomes safe to lower the PoW chain reward by maybe ~4x. Further reductions would happen when the PoW chain stops entirely. [Vitalik] Q: During Phase 0, will ETH 2.0 be transferrable between wallets? 2.0 to 2.0? If so, are there concerns exchanges will list ETH 2.0? A: Transfers will probably only go live in Phase 1 at which point exchanges will list ETH2.0. Having exchanges to so will help maintain price-parity between ETH and ETH2.0. [Carl] Q: if block reward is X eth, and it is enough to secure the block, why do we pay X+gas to miners? Will this change? A: In Eth2 the economic security is not a direct function of the block rewards. Instead, it is a function of the total amount at stake. Will this change? Eth2 should have a partial fee burning mechanism (see EIP1559). [Justin] Q: As ETH 2.0 currently stands what are the odds of a uni-directional vs bi-directional 1.x to 2.0 bridge? A: The uni-directional Eth1 -> Eth2 bridge comes with the beacon chain. I'd say it's likely there will be a bi-directional bridge eventually (though unlikely to happen in 2020). Even better than a bi-directional bridge (based on light clients, which comes with non-negligible latency) is native integration of Eth1 into Eth2 (see here). [Justin] Q: Will the issuance rate be enough to incentivize validators given the competition from say DeFi products and will it be changed in the future if needed? A: Compound rates for ETH are ~0.02% AFAIK, so very easy to compete with. The \"do you take 3% interest staking or 6% lending DAI on Compound\" framing is highly misleading, because that 6% is on USD, which is very different to having 3% on ETH. But over time I do expect interest rates on ETH to slide up as more forms of staking become available (eg. channels, Plasma, Truebit, other security deposit games...). [Vitalik] Q: What are the research team's thoughts / plans on if there is extreme price differences between ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0? I would think arbitrage would solve the issue but haven't thought too deeply on the subject myself. In paticular, if ETH 1.0 coins are worth significantly more causing people to not want to redeem their ETH 2.0 coins because they will instantly take a price hit versus just selling. A: I'm not too worried: Transfers and exchanges can be used to redeploy \"cheap\" Eth2 coins for validation. Large holders (e.g. the EF) can be arbitragers. The greater the price delta, the greater the incentive to deliver a two-way bridge ASAP. [Justin] Q: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? If no, is there any other mechanism to prevent adversaries that can corrupt a shard quickly from applying an invalid state transition? A: Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yep! If yes, are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Looks like ~10x data (though very low computation, and we expect data to be cheaper than computation). But with techniques like https://ethresear.ch/t/layer-2-state-schemes/5691, even that could potentially be unnecessary. [Vitalik] Is it still the plan that the frequently rotated notaries perform stateless validation of the blocks? Yes. are there any insights into how much extra network overhead will sending blocks with merkle proofs incur? Now that execution engines are application layer, the answer is technically 0 :) For execution engines that use large Merkle trees (e.g. Eth1) the rough estimate at one point was 8x. I'm personally excited for execution engines that do Merkle path \"witness compression\" using SNARKs (proof creation accelerated by GPUs, FPGAs, or even ASICs). [Justin] Q: What is the current design to move Ether tokens on eth1 to eth2? A: That depends on what you mean by \"Ether tokens\". Validators can send a deposit of 32 ETH to the deposit contract which is then transferred to the beacon chain where they can begin validation. For people who wish to transfer their ETH from Eth1->2, that is not something that has been decided upon yet, but there will (probably) exist a dedicated bridge for this purpose (otherwise they can go through the deposit contract). It is still too early to know about ERC20/721 tokens. If Eth2 has an Eth1 execution engine, then it could be pretty painless, but even if not, an ERC20 token could just be transferred by copying over its state root. [Carl] Q: Sorry in advance if my questions are dumb but I didn't follow closely Ethereum 2.0 for couple months. Is there an approximative release date? Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? A: Is there an approximative release date? January 3, 2020 at the earliest for phase 0. I'd say Q1 2020 is likely. Concerning staking, how much is needed and do we know for now the rewards? 32 ETH. Rewards depend on the total number of validators, individual validator performance, and the gas markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the typical validator has an annual return around 10%. What is the main point in eth2.0 you are the most proud of? I'm proud to have been able to make a contribution in a beautiful piece of infrastructure I believe will radically change the world in a positive way :) Do you feel that the Binance Chain is an enemy to Ethereum? No. [Justin] Q: When sharding is released, will there just suddenly be 1024 shards in existence, or will there be a small but growing number of shards as usage goes up? Starting with such a high number will leave a lot of unused space/capacity A: All 1024 shards will be launched at once. Growing the number of shards is (probably) unneeded complexity. Shards with lots of unused capacity will have lower gas prices attracting more users. Q: How can the average person help with eth2.0? Donations? Documentation? Are there any organized efforts underway? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: After the scaling issues are solved will this be an economical platform to host backend logic on? How will this compare to running your own server or going through a cloud hosting company in terms of cost and ease of use for light or heavy workloads? Personally, my highest anticipated use case is hosting multiplayer matchmaking and signaling, though I haven\u2019t built such a system yet out of concern for difficulty and cost. A: It's unlikely that Eth2 on its will be used as a backend for heavy workloads, the data throughput is likely just too high. That said, it works really well as a dispute resolution layer so a centralised service can run the backend optimistically and if someone disagrees with the execution, they can contest and have it resolved on Eth2. For lighter use-cases it probably can, but this is more in the context of a dapp. [Carl] Q: I was under the assumption that ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain, no need to swap coins or anything but will this transition from ETH1 to ETH2 cause a fork in the community similar to ETC Ethereum classic and ETH chain? Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? A: ETH would just update to the new ETH 2.0 chain Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Eth2 is such a big upgrade over Eth1 that it is easier to implement as an entirely new chain than to upgrade. See Justin's ELI5 here for more . Does the circulating supply of ETH 2.0 depend on how many people 'evolve' their ETH1 tokens to ETH2 tokens? The large majority of it, yes. Rewards are also issued on the Eth2 chain so that increases the supply there too. Ultimately, the expectation is that all Eth1 ETH will be transferred to Eth2. Q: Do you think its worth laying 6 month/1 year/2 year 'ground rules' for Eth 2.0 chain assuming something unexpectedly goes wrong? A: My concern with doing something like this is its inflexibility. It is basically impossible to cover all the possible cases and even if we could, I'd argue that such an approach is too inflexible to handle the intricacies of exactly how something has failed. Handling it on a case-by-case basis seems like a better solution to me. [Carl] Q: Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? For example like proposed with Casper, every 100th block will be validated by PoS. A: The integration between Eth1 and Eth2 is a roadmap orthogonal to phases 1, 2, 3 of Eth2. Are there any plans to have the ETH 2.0 chain finalize blocks of the ETH 1.0 chain during Phase 0? My best guess is this will happen in 2021. See here . [Justin] Q: What happens if you send more ETH to the deposit contract? Like 32.1 or 40? A: Nothing is stopping you from sending >32 Eth to the deposit contract, but you'll only receive rewards on the first 32 Eth, so it's not something I'd really recommend. [Carl] That's fine. Your balance will reflect the deposit, and the balance in excess of 32 ETH can be transferred to another validator (phase 1) or to a shard (phase 2). [Justin] Q: What's the easiest set up to stake let's say 320 ETH? A: A laptop should be capable of handling around 10 validators so you should be able to send 10*32 Eth to the deposit contract and start validating on your 1 machine. [Carl] A laptop should be sufficient. We'll know more in a few months when the numbers for block sizes and gas limits of shard blocks get finalized. [Vitalik] Q: What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I read you're involved in discussions with them, have you helped each other in developing code? A: I read you're involved in discussions with them I've had brief VDF discussions with Harmony. have you helped each other in developing code? Don't think so, at least not yet. What's your opinion on Harmony one's approach to a high scalability smart contract platform using PoS? I had a brief look at their whitepaper which seems to be inspired by Ethereum. So I guess my opinion is that their approach to scalability is great :) [Justin] Q: If Eth 2.0 introduces PoS, are there legal hurdles to be clarified upon? Could the token be considered a security token? A: I'm not aware of any jurisdiction that considers ETH on Eth1 a security, and since ETH on Eth2 is basically the same as ETH on Eth1 (other than the temporary technicality of two separate tokens) then ETH on Eth2 should not be a security. [Justin] Q: I'm planning to run a beacon node + N validators. Do you think this will will be able to be managed by a Raspberry Pi 4? I'm aware that it is being worked out to have ARM64 binaries ready soon, the question is if it seems realistic not to have a computer running at home and instead running something smaller and cleaner environmentally speaking like a Pi4. A: That depends on \"N\". I (personally) fully expect a RPi3 to be able to run at least one validator node, but we'll only know this when clients are closer to delivery. [Carl] Q: What are some smaller things that you guys would like an average r/ethtrader community member could help with? A: Educating yourself enough to feel comfortable to participate as a validator would be fantastic :) [Justin] Q: Is there any clarity on the transition process regarding basic aspects like whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example, and whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? Better asked, how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? A: whether Beacon eth can be sold on exchanges for example Beacon eth will be sellable on exchanges when transfers are enabled in phase 1. whether the PoW chain knows of the Beacon eth? That will come later, see here . how do you ensure there is one network when there are two chains? The long term plan is to natively integrate Eth1 into Eth2. See here . [Justin] Q: Can you explain somewhat precisely how cross sharding communication would work. As in how does shard node A talk to shard node B without going through some sort of intermediary? If they can do this talking, why can't it be used for eth to talk to say bitcoin. A: The intermediary is the beacon chain, or infrastructure optimistically predicting what will eventually get finalised in the beacon chain. [Justin] Q: How would you objectively judge the level of technological advancement of current eth and current bitcoin as far as the very limited function of sending coins from A to B is concerned? A: Eth1 and Bitcoin are comparable for on-chain payments. [Justin] Q: Presuming you agree price drives security, and presuming you agree all cryptos reside in a very competitive environment, are there any plans to address the increased issuance that the Beacon chain would bring? In addition, are there any plans to meet or maybe even surpass bitcoin's coded reduction of new supply to 2% next year. And related, what would you say to the criticisms that have already been expressed whereby if you can reduce issuance by say 10x, you can increase it too. Or asked in a more open question manner, what do you think of this process through which increases or decreases of issuance are made? A: It's possible Eth2 will cause net-negative issuance. The reason is that ETH gets burned via transaction fees. Pushing code to the beacon chain will also burn ETH. Finality, the penalties also burns ETH. [Justin] Q: Will phase 0 contain any scalability improvements? How many transactions per second will Ethereum be able to handle with Sharding? A: Phase 0 will allow for a light client that can give you hashes of the eth1 chain in a fairly lightweight way (but not too lightweight, you'll need ~200kb per 6 minutes to keep up with the committees, this will go down to 200kb per a few days with phase 1). This could be used to allow eg. light clients inside of browsers to work efficiently. That's a kind of scalability improvement, and an underdiscussed one imo. [Vitalik] Phase 0's purpose is tracking validators' states and producing randomness, asking about its scalability is not really meaningful. Regarding Tx/s, the answer is not really known. As a basic calculation, if each shard has the same throughput as Eth1.x, then we'll have 16 * 1024 = 16,384 Tx/s (assuming no inter-shard Txs). That said, the above numbers are kinda meaningless as Eth2 is designed to be used along with L2 scaling solutions like Rollups and OVM which could yield insanely high throughputs. [Carl] Q: Can you address points 2 - 4 in this tweet ? A: The default idea for clocks in eth2 is https://ethresear.ch/t/network-adjusted-timestamps/4187. There has not been that much work done on writing \"policeman\" software that would detect slashable violations by validators and penalize them, but I am not worried about this. Reasons: Even if no one writes the code, that just means the security model degrades to honest majority, which is not the worst One client implementing the code correctly is sufficient If a client implements the code badly, there's no consensus risk, they could just ship with badly written code that only works half the time and it would catch half the slashable violations. I'll defer to Danny on wire protocol stuff. [Vitalik] Point 2: \"Wire protocol\" => This is an implementation detail that I'm sure the implementers will agree upon soon enough :) The high-level recommendation from the research team is to use libp2p as the networking stack (dicv5 for discovery) and SSZ for serialisation. But this cannot enforced at the consensus layer, and we've already seen alternatives (e.g. clients using Whiteblock for networking, and Prysm is using protobufs in some places). Point 3: \"Clients to slash surround votes\" => Not sure what this means. The spec clearly defines the slashing mechanism for surround votes. See is_slashable_attestation_data. Point 4: \"Decentralized network time protocol\" => Just like Eth1, clocking is an implementation detail. It is to an extent decentralised (e.g. there are alternatives to NTP such as GPS, one can choose his/her NTP servers, one can use local clocks, etc.). It would be nice to have something even more robust but this is research territory\u2014not required for launch of Eth2. [Justin] Q: Why aren't Beacon nodes rewarded? Wouldn't this allow the network to be more decentralized? A: Validators are rewarded. Beacon nodes that are not validators are not rewarded in protocol because the protocol can't tell who's a beacon node vs just pretending to be one (eg. via 100 fake nodes pointing to the same real node). Though non-validator nodes may be able to earn money in eth2 through incentivized light client protocols. Q: In regards to the recent proposal of vitalik to use the bcash chain as a short-term scaling solution until eth 2.0 launches: is eth 2.0 still on track? is there a concrete demand for an interim solution? A: The main motivation for proposing an interim solution (if you don't like bitcoin cash for political reasons, I also recommended ethereum classic, I think it's also a good choice) is to make it easier for the work on building these layer 2s to be able to get off the ground in parallel with finalizing the work on the eth2 layer 1 itself. In general, the ethereum community is large, so doing things in parallel is its advantage. [Vitalik] Q: You do not plan to work on the creation of parachain (eth 2.0.) On Polkadot? I don't think EF will have to drive this. Web3/Parity are on it and I believe consider it to be a top priority. The Shasper (Parity) client is written in substrate to help facilitate this happening. [Danny] Q: Pretty basic but what's a realistic estimate of throughput after every is put together? A: Somewhere between 5000 and 500000 TPS depending on what execution environment and transaction type you're using. [Vitalik] Q: Could you say anything about the adoption of Ethereum Blockchain? Are there plans to create something like a B2B team actively approaching \"qualified\" companys? A: I'd say the Ethereum Foundation's primary focus is the consensus layer (research, development, education, maintenance, etc.), more so than the application layer. [Justin]","title":"Part 2"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#data-questions-with-justin-drake","text":"Q: How much data will there be in Eth2? JD: As the spec currently stands, on average 2.8MB/s across all shards with a \"burst mode\" which is 4x that (i.e. 11.3MB/s). Q: What does this translate into for state size? JD: At the consensus layer block size and state size are basically orthogonal considerations. Consensus-layer state size will always remain very small since we lean heavily on stateless clients. In theory application-layer state (\"L2 state\") can grow up to 2.8MB/s. For execution engines without state rent, you can expect state to grow roughly as fast as Eth1 state grows today. Multiply that by 1024 shards and the situation is possibly not long-term sustainable. This is a significant reason why I personally believe we should progressively launch execution engines (as opposed to allowing anyone to deploy EEs at launch), starting with an EE that has state rent. Q: What role do nodes play (versus validators)? JD: At the consensus layer non-validator nodes don't play any role. At the networking layer they can act as lubricants to relay message. They may also help create blocks for block proposers, i.e. be \"relayers\". Q: Who will run these nodes? JD: Nodes can be run by anyone who wants \"direct\" access to Eth2 (e.g. service providers such as exchanges, etherscan, power users). Relayer nodes may be run by specialised businesses. Q:For someone that needs to run a node (EtherScan), what will the resourcing look like? JD: They will get their data by being nodes and listening on the gossip networks. The bad news is that bandwidth should grow by roughly 1024x to keep track of all shards. But then again, that's not terrible news because a good internet connection (especially server-class) can handle 4 11.2MB/s (the 4 is, say, the gossiping overhead). The good news is that consensus state is minimal (again, stateless clients), which means zero consensus-layer I/O which is currently an Eth1 bottleneck. They can then choose withever EEs and/or dApps it wants to support, i.e. it's opt-in. Q:How do we assume all data is stored and available? JD: For recent blocks we have quite sophisticated infrastructure, including proofs of custody in phase 1 and data availability proofs (possibly phase 2). For historical blocks we rely on the ecosystem to keep them around. Q:What will \"historical blocks\" be needed for. As in, if they were lost forever, what would be messed up? JD: Historical blocks are required to recompute application-layer state, and may also contain application-layer receipts. If they were lost forever (which I don't expect would ever happen) then applications without at least one synced full node may lose user state. Q:Will people congregate on a few shards? JD: Hard to tell. Naive dApp design would suggest that dApps would aggregate into clusters within shard boundaries. We are exploring dApp designs that are somewhat shard-agnostic, i.e. consume data availability from shards as a fungible resource. Q:Quick explanation of cross shard communication and where research is? JD: Cross shard communication is a huge design space, just like \"plasma\" or \"state channels\". At the consensus layer we don't provide much infrastructure beyond crosslinks. I'm expecting significant experimentation in the early days followed by standardisation, somewhat similar to the token transfer design space and the ERC20 standard. One big idea is the concept of \"optimistic crosslink\" which are shared between shards in advance of the real crosslinks, and which with high probability will match the actual crosslinks that get finalised. dApps can use optimistic crosslinks to get super-low cross-shard latency. Q:Why 1024 shards? JD: Because 2048 shards would be stressing the beacon chain and 512 shards would be under-utilising the beacon chain.","title":"Data Questions with Justin Drake"},{"location":"other/ethereum-2.0-ama/#resources","text":"Part 1 Part 2","title":"Resources:"},{"location":"other/ethereum-blog-archive/","text":"Ethereum.org Blog Archive Blog Archive December 2013 Bootstrapping A Decentralized Autonomous Corporation: Part I Bootstrapping An Autonomous Decentralized Corporation, Part 2: Interacting With the World Bootstrapping a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation, Part 3: Identity Corp January 2014 Slasher: A Punitive Proof-of-Stake Algorithm Ethereum: Now Going Public Conference, Alpha Testnet and Ether Pre-sale Updates February 2014 On Transaction Fees, And The Fallacy of Market-Based Solutions Introducing Ethereum Script 2.0 More Thoughts on Scripting and Future-Compatibility Cryptographic Code Obfuscation: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Are About to Take a Huge Leap Forward Why Not Just Use X?

All the ideas presented below are just that - ideas. We encourage everyone to submit their own ideas and start discussions around what can be done to improve the Grants Process within Ethereum. Summary This document was sparked by a recent Twitter thread where members of the Ethereum community came together to create a document aimed at disscussing ideas for new methods and processes that the Ethereum Foundation and it's community can work on to make the Grants process the best it can be for its recipients. The Discussion Main variables to consider prior to giving the grant Firstly, work should already be in progress. Is the project working towards an achievable goal? The team is recommended to have experience delivering ETH/DLT solutions Teams that are potential recipients of a grant should have a brief initial chat with EF to getting to know them, how they work and what their goals are. There needs to be due diligence to some degree. This also may not be necessary if a project with already completed work can be reviewed publicly. The Community (developer community) should be updated with their progress and kept engaged with learning material etc.. What can the Ethereum Foundation do to make the grants process better? The project\u2019s work should have already begun and the project should disclose what the grant will be used for. Grants should not pay for planning rather for execution. Once the applicant receives a Notice of Grant and the funds have been disbursed, they will continue to work on the project. Visibility into grant decisions and why certain amounts are given From a grantee perspective, when receiving a grant of certain amounts it would be nice to know why this particular amount was granted. It would be helpful for the grant provider to explain WHY the grant was awarded and WHY such an amount. It would also be good to clarify what is expected from the specific grant amount. Also, it would be nice to know what the projects have to do in order to potentially receive a follow-up grant etc.. Implement Checkpoints / Demos The grant recipients are responsible for meeting with the foundation grant team for financial reporting requirements and development updates. Disclosure of funds spent A timeline of use-of-funds should be announced prior to receiving the capital. For example, 2 full-time devs and 2 part-time, 40 hours a week and 20 hours a week respectively. Financial reporting includes: How much was spent each month and what it was for For personal privacy/security, there is no need to disclose how much each person received. An idea of what the rest of the funds will be used for Support/Guidance For funds usage and potential advisory: tips/advice on how to use their grants, such as if they should cash out / convert to Dai in order to cover their operations for X amount of time. Some ideas/options include: i. Multi-Sig where the grant funds are held in Dai/Eth This gives a transparent view of the distribution of funds given out on a monthly basis and to fund consumption progress. Perhaps one funding schedule announced by the team, they then give them funds? Clear usage of funds/transparency. The multi-signature wallet requirement ensures redundancy and prevention from accidental loss or theft of funds. ii. The grants process doesn't need to enforce an ideal situation because if a project is working on DLT tech you should be trying to #hodl crypto and pay your workers in tokens. If the EF transfers USD to a foreign account, the banks are going to take a fat ~5% FX fee/premium. If you're not running on USD and you don't want to hold ETH, the team may find it best to take the ETH and sell it at a local exchange (jurisdiction /legal dependent). For example, DAI is, of course, a solution to the volatility issue, but if you're not in the US you're going to struggle to liquidate it to local currency, plus you're taking a position on USD compared to your local labor. iii. As a grant giver, you may need the developer community or foundation to help out. It is what the project needs - some are self-sufficient and require very little involvement but others may need some hand-holding and need an army of internal/external resources. iv. Mentoring from the funding foundation to help guide the grantee. This would include reporting to the funding foundation on a scheduled basis. Where the mentor can chat with the team about the overall financial status and project performance of the grant project. Product market fit (PMF) - This section is optional/dependant on the project origins Implement regular PMF analysis and identify whether the portfolio company will survive in the long run and then assist them in refining their PMF (if it is not too late). This section is optional/dependant on the project because some grants aren't concerned with market fit. For example, many documentation or research projects aren't going to be valuable in any market. Encourage inter-grantees company partnerships and synergies When a company gets a grant from a foundation, they agree to work together and it should be a win-win partnership. Closeout requirements This process includes a review of the final financial and technical progress from the grantee, the grant lifecycle end. The project is then considered for a follow-up grant or the grant process closes.

Currently, nearly all documentation and resources for Ethereum are written in English. In order for the Ethereum community to become truly global, it needs to become more accessible to those who do not speak English. EthHub can play a vital role in this process. This page was created to plan the roadmap for translating EthHub into multiple languages. How Can I help? Join the EthHub discord and request to join the Internationalization working group Learn to make pull requests from the section above. To translate a page, simply navigate to the branch for your desired language and make a pull request on the page you translate. General plan This plan was the original outline for translating EthHub. Updates to this plan are needed. Target Audiences Spanish Chinese Hindi Arabic Funding Funding would be necessary to incentivize and compensate the translators. Strategy Translating EthHub is going to be no small feat especially when it comes to maintainence. It would be nearly impossible to actively translate every pull request as they are submitted. It makes more sense to create checkpoints or editions for the international versions of EthHub. This would allow us to carefully plan and review the required materials to be included and translated. Formalizing English edition The EthHub community will need to go through the entire site and determine what information needs to be written, edited, and reviewed before it is handed over to the translators. By creating editions instead of sister sites, we won't have to aim for a moving target. It may be appropriate to create a branch of the Github repo dedicated to each edition. Translating into target languages There are two ways we can go about translating the materials: recruit and fund each translation team or place bounties on each page and rely on individual contributions. Place bounties for translating each section After the English edition is finalized, a translation branch could be made for each language and a bounty could be placed for each section or page. Gitcoin bounties would be used to place bounties for translating each EthHub page, page section, and/or graphic. Individual contributors could translate each page and claim the bounty. One downside to this method would be that it would still require editors to oversee each bounty and review that the translation is refined. Recruit and fund translation teams Teams of contributors could be selected and funded to oversee the translation of the entire translation process. Milestones or bounties could be created to distribute the funding. The team members would also review one another's work. Publication and Distribution Since we're going through the effort to formalize editions, we could publish the work.

Answer In the US, the SEC has not issued a formal ruling, but recent comments suggest that they do not believe Ether is a security. Other jurisdictions have not made this distinction clear. Explanation Note: this question answers whether Ether fits the legal definition of a security. In the US, the SEC uses the Howey test to determine whether something can be legally considered a security. The test comes from the Supreme Court ruling in 1946 for SEC v. W.J. Howey Co . It stipulates four criteria: Requires investment of money (fiat currency) Money invested with expectation of profit Invested money goes toward a common enterprise Profit is generated by the efforts of a promoter or third party Ether easily fits the first two criteria. People buy Ether with fiat currency, and many do so with the expectation of profit. However, the second two criteria are more difficult to prove. First, money used to purchase Ether does not necessarily go toward a common enterprise. In its current form, purchased Ether only permits usage of the network, not ownership to an enterprise. This condition may change under Proof-of-Stake given that Ether offers people the ability to earn returns while securing the network. Even so, this feature does not fit cleanly into the traditional definition of a common enterprise. Second, Ethereum does not generate profit, nor does it rely on the efforts of a promoter or third party. Ethereum is a network, not a corporation, so it does not produce identifiable profits beyond the value appreciation of Ether. The value of Ether also originates from open source development.

Ether is necessary for Ethereum network security and operational efficiency for miners. Explanation The notion that transaction fees on Ethereum can be paid in-protocol by something other than ether (such as an ERC20 token) is called 'economic abstraction'. We explain why the Ethereum protocol is unlikely to integrate economic abstraction below. Economic abstraction is often used to argue that the value of Ether will go to 0. The theory is that users could pay their transaction costs to miners in something other than Ether. Therefore, if that becomes rampant, Ether itself would have no value. This argument can be used on any Proof-of-Work blockchain, it's an especially popular criticism against Ethereum since it appears easy to create additional ERC20 tokens that can be exchanged for Ether. Quick recap on how transactions work on Ethereum. Each transaction uses a set amount of gas. Users pay miners to include their transaction using a gas price. Gas * Gas Price = transaction cost. The base protocol assumes gas price in ETH and every wallet calculates transaction cost in total ETH to pay. The argument against ETH value begins here. It says that users could pay their transaction cost in some currency or token instead of Ether, including digital USD. Miners could then directly sell tokens or currency into the currency of their choice. While rebuilding Ethereum to accept multiple currencies (even USD) is theoretically possible, this argument ignores how digital native tokens like Ether or Bitcoin act as a layer of security for the system. Tokens like Ether reduce the profitability of network hacks by tying network security to the value of the network's medium of exchange. If network security gets hit, so does the value of the token transacted on the network. Imagine a rogue miner on Ethereum gathers enough computing power to successfully 51% attack the network and divert the network's currency to a personal account. If the currency's value isn't tied to network security (say, USD), the hacker could easily sell these proceeds at full value in reasonably liquid markets. This cannot happen with Ether. Other miners would see this behavior immediately and make it known to relevant markets for Ether. As a result, not only would prices for Ether drop, Ether would also become highly illiquid, making it difficult for the hacker to make off with the pre-hack market value of the stolen Ether. This argument applies for any decentralized blockchain, including Bitcoin. Practically speaking, paying with multiple currencies also adds friction, cost, and a UX nightmare to the operations of a miner. It would have to go through the following process: Open communication with a miner Manually calc the cost of the tx in that tokens value Send miner payment & wait for confirm Execute initial TX and get the nonce Tell the miner the nonce and wait for his next block On top of the added friction to users mentioned above, there is an added cost to users to pay for their transaction in something other than ETH. Sending ETH in a transaction costs 21000 gas while sending tokens costs 40000 gas or more. Calculating gas cost and understanding the gas market is no easy task. Wallets have spent years making this UX smooth. There is no incentive for a wallet to streamline the payment of gas in tokens as the complexities are deep. Now let's talk about miners. Miners are trying to make a profit and have to pay for hardware/electricity costs. They do not want to have a portfolio of 50 different cryptocurrencies with wild volatility and no liquidity. This creates an operational nightmare. As mentioned, this is possible on all PoW chains. Bitcoin even has a tool that enables users to pay for transaction speed in payments other than BTC http://confirmtx.com . However, because of the arguments above, it's not rampant in BTC or ETH because it violates core security assumptions and has extreme practical limitations for miners.

Answer No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices. Explanation Basics of a transaction There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question. First, it's essential to understand how an Ethereum transaction works. As explained in the gas section , every transaction that occurs on the network requires a set amount of gas, which is a unit used to measure the computational power required to process the transaction. To process a transaction and include it in a block, miners expect to be compensated. This is accomplished by setting a gas price with every transaction, which is the cost of 1 unit of gas, denominated in Gwei (1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei). For example, when you simply send ETH from one account to another, this cost 21000 gas. If you were to set a gas price of 1 Gwei, this transaction would cost 0.000021 ETH. Fee market Currently, the Ethereum network is working at or near capacity. This means that a fee market is created because some users may be willing to pay more to get to the front of the line while others may not be in as big of a rush. Tools such as EthGasStation offer a great view into the current fee market and what it current costs to get a basic or fast transaction through. You'll notice that so far, we haven't talked about fiat or the cost of a transaction in fiat value. That's because at its core, the fee market is independent from the cost of Ether. Users have the ability to send a transaction from 0 gas price all the way to as high as they'd like and miners have the ability to accept the same range. Rising and falling Ether price While the gas market by design is purely Ether related, it'd be misleading to not acknowledge that a lot of users and miners think of their fees in fiat terms. So while the above example may have cost 0.000021 ETH, some users will instead think of that in terms of fiat cost ($0.002793 for instance). This means that the fee market, while independent of fiat prices at its core, will react to moves in Ether prices. If we use the example above and assume price spikes 5x, all of a sudden that transaction will cost $0.0139 in fiat terms. When price spikes (assuming network demand stays the same), users will start to lower their gas price. When price falls (assuming network demand stays the same), miners will start to raise their minimum accepted gas. We can see the fluctuation in average gas price in the past. Network demand As previously mentioned, network demand plays a much larger role on gas price than Ether price. If no one was using the network, gas prices paid would be near 0. If the network is full, gas prices will start to spike. This is an important consideration when trying to draw conclusions between Ether price and gas prices paid.","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises? - EthHub"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises","text":"","title":"Is Ethereum more expensive to use as price rises?"},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#answer","text":"No, the Ethereum fee market is independent of fiat prices.","title":"Answer  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#explanation","text":"","title":"Explanation  "},{"location":"questions-about-ethereum/is-ethereum-more-expensive-to-use-as-price-rises/#basics-of-a-transaction","text":"There are many concepts to understand when diving into the answer to this question.

Summary Ethereum's \"Difficulty Bomb\" refers to a mechanism that, at a predefined block number, increases the difficulty level of puzzles in the Proof of Work mining algorithm resulting in longer than normal block times (and thus less ETH rewards for miners). This mechanism increases the difficulty exponentially over time and eventually leads to what is referred to as the \"Ice Age\" - that is, the chain becomes so difficult to mine that it grinds to a halt and stops producing blocks (freezes). Why the Difficulty Bomb Exists The Difficulty Bomb was originally put in place for a variety of reasons: To act as a deterrant for miners who wish to continue mining the Ethereum 1.0 (Proof of Work) chain once the network moved fully to the Ethereum 2.0 (Proof of Stake) chain To ensure that the core developers of Ethereum 1.0 are \"forced\" to upgrade the network via a hard fork (if only to delay the effects of the bomb) so that the network does not stagnate innovation-wise Technical Details of the Difficulty Bomb Work in progress. Effects of the Difficulty Bomb The effect of the Difficulty Bomb is easily seen in the 'Ethereum Block Time History' chart from Etherscan (you'll notice that it is a step-function that increases block times the longer that it exists on the chain). Is the Difficulty Bomb Still Necessary? There is an open debate as to whether the Difficulty Bomb is still required because Ethereum 2.0 is now being deployed as a seperate blockchain (instead of a direct upgrade to the Ethereum 1.0 chain) and the bomb has been delayed without any fanfare in both the Byzantine and Constantinople network upgrades.

You're in the right place! This guide will walk you through the necessary steps of getting onboarded to the Ethereum network. Buy ETH In order to interact with the Ethereum network, you will need to own Ether (ETH). The easiest way to acquire ETH is to buy it on Coinbase. One important note is that you do not need to buy 1 full ETH. Ether is divisible down to 18 decimal places so you can buy fractions of it. Setup MetaMask Now that you have ETH, you will want to send it to a wallet of your choice to store it and use it on the network. Wallets setup accounts for you which are randomly generated 42 character long addresses starting with 0x. Accounts allow you to store and use ETH by generating transactions on the Ethereum network. We recommend first moving your ETH to the MetaMask wallet . MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum dapps inside of Chrome, Brave, Firefox or Opera. MetaMask has a nice video to help you get setup: After MetaMask is setup, you now have your own wallet address (0x......). You can go to Coinbase and send your acquired ETH to your new wallet address. This should take about a minute and you will see the ETH show up in your MetaMask wallet. Setup Mobile Wallet (optional) Every Ethereum account can be restored via a random string of words. In the MetaMask setup above this was referred to as the seed phrase. It is possible to have this same account in multiple different wallets, including mobile wallets . We recommend downloading Coinbase Wallet , clicking restore and typing in your seed phrase. Your wallet is now also mobilized! Try Ethereum Applications Now that you have ETH in a wallet of your own, you can use any of the amazing applications (sometimes referred to as dapps) that have been built on Ethereum. There are many different types of applications built on Ethereum but here are a few suggestions to get started: Decentralized Finance Compound : Lend and borrow ETH or other tokens. Uniswap : Easily trade your ETH for other tokens. Games CryptoKitties : Collect and breed digital cats. Gods Unchained : Free-to-play digital trading card game built on Ethereum. Collectibles OpenSea : Buy, sell and discover rare digital items. Origin Protocol : Decentralized marketplaces on the blockchain. Other ENS : Buy an ENS name to give your address a more human readable format (myetheraddress.eth). PoolTogether : Join a no-loss lottery for a chance to win a prize. Long term storage As you continue to use Ethereum, you might start to acquire more ETH and other tokens. It is highly recommended to store larger amounts of crypto in solutions such as hardware wallets and smart contract wallets which are more secure than basic account wallets. Hardware wallets are the most-secure method for accessing your funds while online, as they do not expose your private key to the internet when signing transactions. Smart contract wallets are wallets with unique abilities due to the power of smart contract functionality.

Mining is the process of creating a block of transactions to be added to the Ethereum blockchain. Miners essentially process pending transactions and are awarded block rewards in the form of Ether, the Ethereum network's native currency, for each block generated. Generating a block requires intensive computational work (or hashing power) due to the difficulty set by the Ethereum network protocol. This difficulty level is proportional to the total amount of computational power (also known as the total hashrate of the network) being used to mine Ethereum and serves as a way to secure the network from attacks as well as tuning the speed at which blocks (and block rewards) are generated. This system of using hashing power generated by costly computer hardware is known as Proof of Work (PoW). Who can become a miner on the Ethereum network? Technically, anyone is able to mine on the Ethereum network using their computer. However, not everyone is able to mine Ether profitably. In most cases, miners must purchase dedicated computer hardware in order to mine profitably. While it is true anyone can run the mining software on their computer, it is unlikely that the average computer would be able to earn enough block rewards to cover the associated costs of mining (See question below for more details). What are the costs associated with mining? Potential costs of the hardware necessary to build and maintain a mining rig Electrical cost of powering the mining rig If you are mining in a pool, mining pools fees typically charge a flat % fee of each block generated by the pool Potential cost of equipment to support mining rig (ventilation, energy monitoring, electrical wiring, etc.) Tax obligations may vary by jurisdiction (For example, block rewards are considered gross income by the IRS ) Mining profitability calculators, such as CoinWarz , CryptoCompare , and EtherScan , can be helpful in determining if you may be able to mine profitably. Note that mining calculators may not 100% accurate and it may be useful to compare and contrast several results. Where can I find the latest information on mining? /r/EtherMining Subreddit How much longer will Ethereum mining be around? See Serenity phases for more information. Block Generation Block structure A block consists a header, which includes information identifying the block and linking it to the rest of the chain, and a body of transactions. Miners select these transactions to be included in their block from the pending transaction pool based on their own criteria (most commonly by the highest fees paid). Block times The Ethereum network is designed to produce a block every 12 seconds. Block times will vary based upon how long it takes miners to generate a hash that meets the required mining difficulty at that moment. 12 seconds was chosen as a time that is as fast as possible, but is at the same time substantially longer than network latency. A 2013 paper by Decker and Wattenhofer in Zurich measured Bitcoin network latency and determined that 12.6 seconds is the time it takes for a new block to propagate to 95% of nodes. The goal of the 12 second design is to allow the network to propagate blocks as fast as possible without causing miners to find a significant number of stale blocks. Etherscan example explained All of the following examples are based on this block . Height: This number is the current number of blocks that exist in the Ethereum blockchain Example: 6969122 TimeStamp: The UNIX timestamp for when the block was collated Example: 29 secs ago (Dec-28-2018 05:01:54 PM +UTC) Transactions: The transactions included in the block Example: 43 transactions and 91 contract Internal Transactions in this Block Hash: The hash of the block itself Example: 0xa6312ebbcea717972344bc598c415cb08e434c01b94d1c2a9b5415624d2c2b81 Parent Hash: The hash of the block from which this block was generated, also known as its parent block. Example: 0xa48e2ad13de011f127b345a81a91933d221f5a60d45852e7d7c2b5a07fda9fe2 Sha3Uncles: A SHA3 hash of the uncle block data included in the block Example: 0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347 Mined By: The address of who mined the block and received the block reward Example: 0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c (SparkPool) in 2 secs Difficulty: A number that represents the difficulty required to mine this block Example: 2,511,265,102,818,605 Total Difficulty: A number that represents the total mining difficulty of the chain up until this block Example: 8,470,035,190,867,378,349,872 Size: The size of the block file in bytes Example: 13160 bytes Gas Used: The total amount of gas used by all the transactions included in this block Example: 7,997,769 (99.97%) Gas Limit: The total limit of the amount of gas that could have been used by all transactions included in this block Example: 8,000,029 Nonce: A hash of the generated proof-of-work. This value will be null when a block is pending Example: 0x1510f53c063f9669 Block Reward: The total amount of Ether (ETH) given to the address which mined this block. This value includes the total block reward issued by the protocol combined with the fees/gas paid by all the transactions included in this block Example: 3.032755182184797136 Ether (3 + 0.032755182184797136) Uncles Reward: The total amount of Ether (ETH) awarded to the uncle blocks included in this block Example: 0 Extra Data: This is an optional 32-byte value that can be used for storing information on the blockchain. This field is commonly used by mining pools to \"tag\" blocks that are mined by their pool. Example: sparkpool-eth-cn-hz2 (Hex:0x737061726b706f6f6c2d6574682d636e2d687a32) Uncle Blocks Uncle blocks are stale blocks that are included in the calculation of which chain is the \"longest\"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale descendants of the block's ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, \"uncles\") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it. Block rewards are given to stales: a stale block receives 87.5% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes the stale block receives the remaining 12.5%. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncles. Ethereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only goes down seven levels. Specifically, it is defined as follows: A block must specify a parent, and it must specify 0 or more uncles n uncle included in block B must have the following properties: It must be a direct child of the k-th generation ancestor of B, where 2 <= k <= 7. It cannot be an ancestor of B An uncle must be a valid block header, but does not need to be a previously verified or even valid block An uncle must be different from all uncles included in previous blocks and all other uncles included in the same block (non-double-inclusion) For every uncle U in block B, the miner of B gets an additional 3.125% added to its coinbase reward and the miner of U gets 93.75% of a standard coinbase reward. This limited version of GHOST, with uncles includable only up to 7 generations, was used for two reasons. First, unlimited GHOST would include too many complications into the calculation of which uncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with compensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a miner to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public attacker.

The EVM - the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on each Ethereum node - is an emulation of a computer system. One example of a regular, non-blockchain virtual machine is the VirtualBox software, which allows you to emulate computer systems (guests) on your physical hardware (hosts). Any operation in the EVM consumes CPU cycles, disk access, memory, of the hosting machine (which carries a cost). This cost is paid via Ethereum 'gas'. In order to prevent \"overload\" of the host, each operation on the EVM consumes a certain amount of gas. Accessing memory or writing to disk have differing costs with each EVM operator setting an upper limit to the gas consumed during execution of a contract. So, if a malicious operator crafted a smart contract that went into an infinite loop, each loop would consume some gas and eventually run into the limit, at which point the EVM would abort the execution of this contract. Essentially, the larger, more complex the contract and the more operations it performs, the more expensive it is to run it. This process creates a fee market using gas prices where users decide how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas. Due to the gas block limit, the fee market almost always determines what order transactions are mined in because miners looking to profit will select the transactions with the highest fees. There are many key components to a transaction that are important to understand: Term Description Gas Unit for how much computation work is done. Gas Price How much you\u2019re willing to pay per gas for work (in gwei) Tx Cost Gas used * Gas Price Gas Limit Max gas you\u2019ll pay for a certain tx Gas Block Limit Max gas allowed in a block Fee Market Summary The Ethereum gas block limit means that there is a limit to how many computations can occur per block. This creates a fee market for gas where miners will accept higher paying transactions first. Users that want their transactions to be included first can pay a higher gas price than those who aren't in a rush. Key concepts to understand about the fee market are: Term Description Gas Price How much a user is willing to pay per gas for work (in gwei) Safe Low A price that will be mined in a reasonable time (<50 blocks) Standard Gas Price The average gas price being paid by the network Fast Gas Price A price that will be mined within the next few blocks Signing Transactions on Ethereum Interacting with Smart Contracts via Etherscan and MetaMask Navigate to the Etherscan page for the Contract Address If the code and ABI have been uploaded to Etherscan, you should be able to access the 'Write Contract' tab Click the connect with MetaMask button Follow the documentation provided by the Contract's author to complete your transaction. Interacting with Smart Contracts via MyCrypto Navigate to MyCrypto . Verify the SSL (little green lock next to URL) to avoid phishing sites. Click the 'Contracts' tab Enter the Ethereum address of your desired contract in the 'Contract Address' field Enter the 'ABI / JSON Interface' provided by the contract author into the 'Contract ABI' filed. The ABI allows MyCrypto to display named functions that are invokable for the provided contract address. This code can sometimes be found on the Etherscan page for the contract address under the 'Code' tab. Click 'Access' Follow the contract documentation provided by the contract author to use the desired contract function in the 'Read / Write Contract' dropdown.

Fast SSD with at least 500GB free space. 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service. For light nodes, the requirements are much lower, as you will only be storing block headers and receive small state updates. Setup Download Geth from the official page Extract the compressed archive with your tool of choice There are no system dependencies if using an officially released geth binary, which ships for most architectures and operating systems. Running The first step in running an Ethereum node is synchronizing the Blockchian. There are a few options you can use to specify the sync mode of the geth client: --syncmode \"fast\" --syncmode \"full\" --syncmode \"light\" By default, geth will run in --syncmode \"fast\", this is the recommended option for running a complete Ethereum node. When using \"fast\" synchronization, the node will initially download blocks until it reaches the tip of the Blockchain without performing extensive validation steps. Once your node is in sync with the rest of the network, the node will validate transactions exactly like a full node. When using \"full\" synchronization, the node validates every transaction from downloaded blocks until it reaches the tip of the Blockchain. This is not advised, as it doesn't provide any benefits and can result in the node taking multiple days, or even weeks, to synchronize completely. Once the node is in sync, it will continue full validation of new transactions. When using \"light\" synchronization, the node only downloads a few recent block headers, making it a very quick sync. The drawback to this method is that the node is unable to perform reliable validation, as it doesn't have complete records of the Blockchain. If running on a device with low bandwidth or memory, the light node can be advantageous. The light node gets updated by full nodes once in a while with information on changes pertaining to relevant parts of the Blockchain. When offering services to users which might require complete records, the fast sync options are the best to use. A fast sync node can operate in light mode. Using In the folder extracted from the downloaded archive, the geth program can be run with the desired sync mode and other options. ./geth --syncmode \"option\" When using a light client, beware that it can take up to 10 minutes after the node's initialization before it starts receiving updates from the network.
